/**
 * The bundle must declare every scope the probes call with.
 *
 * THIS IS THE TEST THAT STOPS IT RECURRING, and it is worth saying why the other
 * one is not enough. The diagnosis tests make a missing scope legible once it
 * happens: the row says "the app is short of `vector-search`" instead of
 * printing a GRANT. Good, but still after the fact, on a customer's screen. This
 * one fails at build time, on the developer's machine, on the commit that adds a
 * probe against an API the app never asked permission for.
 *
 * That was the actual gap. The probes were reviewed, tested and audited, and
 * every one of those passes ran under a full local credential where the scopes
 * were irrelevant. Nothing anywhere compared the APIs the probes call against
 * the scopes the app declares, so the two could drift apart silently, and they
 * did -- until a deploy turned twenty-odd rows red at once.
 *
 * Read as TEXT rather than through a YAML parser on purpose. The bundle is
 * variable-interpolated (`${var.app_user_api_scopes}`) and target-layered, so a
 * parse of one file resolves nothing; and `databricks bundle validate` needs a
 * workspace, which a unit test must not need. Reading the literal list under the
 * target is cruder and cannot be fooled by an interpolation that looks right.
