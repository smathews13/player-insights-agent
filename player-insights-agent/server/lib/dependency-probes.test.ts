/**
 * The rules this page rests on, and every one of them is about a distinction
 * that a lazier reading would collapse.
 *
 * The Connections page promises to report "whether it can reach each one" and,
 * for releases, answered `Not checked` for everything but two things the app
 * probes about itself. The fix is that the app now asks the workspace. The risk
 * the fix introduces is the opposite one: a page full of green ticks that mean
 * less than a reader will take them to mean. So these tests are mostly about
 * what a verdict may NOT say -- that a refusal is not an absence, that a silence
 * is not a refusal, that an unset value is not a fault, and that a metadata read
 * is not a promise about data.
