/**
 * What the Cost resources are read from, and what each is allowed to claim.
 *
 * Every figure here comes from `system.billing.usage` priced against
 * `system.billing.list_prices`. Nothing is modelled, carried over from a
 * previous read, or apportioned by an invented ratio. A shared Vector Search
 * endpoint is allocated only by persisted configured-index calls divided by
 * observed Vector Search calls. Where a component cannot be attributed, its
 * tile says so and shows no number, because a component nobody could attribute
 * and a component that cost nothing are different facts and `$0.00` states the
 * second one.
 *
 * THE IDENTIFIERS ARE THE WHOLE PROBLEM. Billing is workspace-wide, so a query
 * that does not name this deployment's own endpoint, warehouse, app and index
 * returns somebody else's spend. Each component below is therefore matched on a
 * `usage_metadata` key that Databricks fills in for that product, and a
 * component whose identifier this deployment has not configured contributes NO
 * BRANCH to the statement at all. It then renders as "not configured" and names
 * the variable to set, which is a true statement about this deployment, rather
 * than as zero, which is a false statement about the bill.
 *
 * The product names and metadata keys were read off the workspace rather than
 * recalled:
 *
 *   MODEL_SERVING     usage_metadata.endpoint_name
 *   SQL               usage_metadata.warehouse_id
 *   APPS              usage_metadata.app_name
 *   VECTOR_SEARCH     usage_metadata.endpoint_name
 *   GENIE             surface and channel, but no Genie space id
 *   LAKEFLOW_CONNECT  no metadata at all, workspace-scoped only
 *
 * The last two are why the Genie and telemetry tiles say they cover the whole
 * workspace. There is no key to narrow them with, and narrowing them by a guess
 * would be the invented number this app has spent months removing.
 *
 * NO IDENTIFIER IS WRITTEN DOWN HERE. Every one arrives as a bound parameter
 * from the environment, so this file carries the shape of the question and a
 * deployment carries its own answer. That is also what keeps a customer's
 * endpoint and warehouse ids out of the repository.

 * nothing hands the app its vector search endpoint name, and no deployment sets a
 * rebuild job id. Two of six tiles are therefore blank, and an admin asking what
 * this thing costs gets a page that mostly declines to answer.
 *
 * There IS a true figure available for those: the product's total across the
 * whole workspace. It is not this deployment's spend, and the entire risk in
 * showing it is that somebody reads it as though it were. So it comes back under
 * its OWN row key, `component:workspace`, which means:
 *
 *  - No sum over the components can pick it up. Anything adding these rows
 *    selects by exact component name, so a workspace total is structurally
 *    ineligible rather than excluded by a filter someone might later "tidy up".
 *  - The tile that renders it is relabelled at the same time: quality becomes
 *    `estimate` and population becomes "Whole workspace", overriding whatever the
 *    narrowed tile would have claimed. A workspace-wide MODEL_SERVING total
 *    presented as `per-token` for this endpoint would be the exact
 *    mislabelling this file exists to prevent.
 *
 * It still requires a workspace id. Without one there is no predicate that keeps
 * the figure inside this workspace, and `system.billing.usage` can carry more
 * than one — so the fallback is unavailable rather than widened.

 * EVERY FIELD IS NOW A CHIP RATHER THAN A SENTENCE. Each entry used to carry a

 * three or four lines of prose around a single figure in a card fifteen
 * characters wide: the cards overflowed, no two in a row were the same height,

 * carrying that had to survive is the POPULATION -- Genie and telemetry
 * ingestion are billed to the whole workspace, and a reader who takes either for
 * this deployment's own spend has misread the block in the most expensive
 * direction available on it. So the population stays, in the fewest words that
 * still say whose money it is, and the quality keeps its badge with no sentence
 * after it.
 *
 * `variable` is '' where there is genuinely nothing to set, which is the vector
