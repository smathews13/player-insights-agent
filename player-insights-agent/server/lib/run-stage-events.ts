/**
 * The steps of a run, written down as they happen, so a reader who walks away
 * mid-question is shown the path again when they come back.
 *
 * THIS IS THE GAP `run-replay.ts` NAMES. Stages were streamed and nothing
 * stored them, so the only durable record of a run in flight was its `runs`
 * row: a state and two timestamps. A browser that reopened a working
 * conversation could therefore learn THAT the agent was working and never
 * WHAT it had done, which is the state a reader reported as the page locking --
 * their question still on screen, the composer shut because a run is in
 * flight, and an agent path that stayed empty however long they waited.
 *
 * WHAT GOES IN THE TABLE, and this is the line the schema's own comment draws:
 * no bearer token, no raw tool result, no attachment text. So this stores the
 * step's identity and shape -- its id, name, kind, status, offset, duration,
 * call count and nesting -- the ARGUMENTS it was given, clamped to the width
 * the rail draws them at, and the explicit fully-qualified table-name
 * projection on a discovery step. The step's OUTPUT is deliberately not
 * stored: that is the tool result the schema rules out. The table projection is
 * an allowlisted list of identifiers rather than raw result text; the
 * authoritative trace arrives with the answer and carries everything.
 *
 * WHY NOT `readStored`. Same reason `run-ledger.ts` avoids it: `readStored`
 * maintains the app-wide storage health that every degradable surface reads,
 * and these tables are new. On a database where their CREATE was refused on
 * ownership, an append here fails while the rest of the store is perfectly
 * healthy, and reporting that as a store-wide outage would take the whole app
 * down to its degraded paths over a table nothing else reads.
