/**
 * Whether the MLflow experiment the traces land in actually exists.
 *
 * THE ONE DEPENDENCY THAT CANNOT BE ASKED ABOUT AS THE READER, and this file is
 * the exception that fact forces. Every other check in this app runs on the
 * signed-in user's forwarded token, deliberately, because the question those
 * checks answer is about that person's own grants. Databricks Apps validates
 * `user_api_scopes` against a fixed list, and that list has no MLflow family at
 * all: `mlflow`, `mlflow.experiments`, `mlflow.experiments:read`,
 * `mlflow-experiments`, `experiments`, `experiments:read`, `ml` and
 * `ml.experiments:read` are each rejected by the Apps API with "not a valid
 * scope". So a user-token probe of the experiment cannot be built, and adding an
 * `experiment-id` subject to `dependency-probes.ts` would resolve to an empty
 * scope and correctly fail `user-api-scopes.test.ts`.
 *
 * IT WAS BADGED `Nothing to reach` INSTEAD, which was worse than saying nothing.
 * That badge means the app both resolves and applies the value and there is no
 * remote end -- true of a warehouse id the app only ever passes on, and false
 * here, on a card that says in the next line that the experiment receives the
 * trace of every run and offers a link to open it. A mistyped or deleted
 * experiment id rendered a dead link under a badge claiming there was nothing
 * there to be wrong.
 *
 * So it is read AS THE APPLICATION, which is the identity that writes the traces
 * in the first place, and every verdict below says so in as many words. The app's
 * read establishes that the experiment exists and that the trace has somewhere to
 * land. It establishes nothing about whether the reader can open it, and a check
 * that let anyone believe otherwise would be the same defect wearing green.
 *
 * The app already reads the workspace as itself for the one other question a
 * forwarded token cannot answer -- what a named person is entitled to, in
 * `monitoring-grants.ts` -- so the identity is not new here, only its use.
