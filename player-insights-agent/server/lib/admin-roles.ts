/**
 * Who administers this deployment, and the refusal that makes it mean something.
 *
 * Every runtime role is a row in Lakebase. Deployment config is only a
 * greenfield bootstrap input: when the roster is empty it is inserted once, and
 * when any row exists it is ignored. A later code deploy therefore cannot alter
 * admins, super admins, or explicit consumer rows.
 *
 * THREE RULES DECIDE EVERY EDGE CASE HERE, and each is a correction of the
 * cost-obs app this mechanism is copied from:
 *
 *   1. An empty roster means NOBODY is an admin, not everybody. cost-obs treats a
 *      fresh deployment with no configured admins as one where every caller is
 *      an admin, so whoever set it up can configure it. This app is published
 *      for customers to deploy into their own workspaces, and a deployment
 *      whose first state is "everyone administers" is a deployment that ships
 *      that way. The one-time config bootstrap solves the same problem without
 *      making config authoritative after the first row exists.
 *   2. A failed read of the stored half DENIES rather than admits. cost-obs
 *      falls through to an empty list on a storage error, and an empty list
 *      admits everyone there.
 *   3. BEING AN ADMIN GRANTS NO ANALYTICAL DATA. Questions still run under the
 *      asker's own Unity Catalog grants, through the forwarded user token,
 *      exactly as they do for a consumer. When the shared-conversation operator
 *      switch is on, routes may use this authoritative role to let admins read
 *      stored app conversations; that does not widen any catalog grant.
 *
 * Nothing in this module reads a header, a query parameter or a body field that
 * claims a role. The caller's address arrives from the one identity reader the
 * app already has, passed in rather than imported, so this file cannot grow a
 * second notion of who is calling.
