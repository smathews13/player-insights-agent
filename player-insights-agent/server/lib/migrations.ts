/**
 * The numbered schema versions, and the rules for adding one.
 *
 * ── WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT MATTERS ──
 *
 * Every table this app stores into used to be created by a flat list of
 * `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` run on every boot. That list still exists, and it
 * is still the definition of version 1, because a database that already holds
 * the customer's history has to converge on it without a single destructive
 * statement. What has changed is that it is now a NUMBERED VERSION with a row in
 * `schema_version` recording that it was applied, which buys three things the
 * flat list could not give:
 *
 *   1. A statement added tomorrow runs ONCE, in order, after the statements it
 *      depends on, instead of being replayed against every database forever and
 *      relying on `IF NOT EXISTS` to make that harmless.
 *   2. An operator can ask the database what version it is at, and a release can
 *      refuse to promote a build whose migrations have not been applied. Before
 *      this, "did the DDL run" was answerable only by reading boot logs.
 *   3. A migration can be UNDONE, because it says how. See `down` below.
 *
 * ── ADDING A MIGRATION: READ THIS FIRST ──
 *
 * Append to {@link LATER_MIGRATIONS}. Never edit an existing entry's
 * `statements`, and never renumber: a version already recorded as applied will
 * not be re-run, so editing it changes what fresh databases get and leaves every
 * existing one behind, which is the specific failure that makes hand-rolled
 * migration tables worse than no migration table at all.
 *
 * **Every statement must still be idempotent.** That is not the usual migration
 * rule and it is not laziness. AppKit hands this app a `pg.Pool` and a bare
 * `query(text, params)` with no way to hold one connection across calls, so
 * THERE ARE NO TRANSACTIONS available to it — the same constraint that put the
 * run ledger's lease on one row. A migration is therefore a sequence of
 * separately-committed statements followed by a separate `INSERT` into
 * `schema_version`, and any of those can be the last one to succeed. Idempotent
 * statements make the re-run that follows a partial application harmless;
 * non-idempotent ones make it a second failure with a different cause.
 *
 * **Nothing here may drop, rename or rewrite a column or table that holds the
 * customer's history.** The `down` of a migration that adds a column drops that
 * column, which is fine because the column is this migration's own. The `down`
 * of a migration that removes data does not exist, and such a migration does not
 * belong in this file — see the lifecycle work, which is a separate piece with
 * its own retention and export decisions.
 *
 * **`CREATE INDEX` and `ALTER TABLE` check ownership before they check
 * `IF NOT EXISTS`.** Postgres refuses them outright when the app's role does not
 * own the table, even when the statement would change nothing. That is not
 * hypothetical here; it is why `run-ledger-schema.ts` declares every constraint
 * inside its own `CREATE TABLE`. The runner survives it by reading the schema to
 * see whether the end state is already in place, but a new `ALTER` against a
 * table the app may not own is still a statement that will be refused on some
 * deployments, so prefer a new table to an altered old one.

 * Why this list could not be trusted, or `null` when it can.
