 * The benchmark runner: runs a suite against the live agent, scores it, and

 *
 * THE TRANSPORT IS INJECTED, NOT BUILT. This module contains no HTTP client of
 * any kind and must not acquire one. The agent endpoint and the judge endpoint
 * are both reached through closures the caller supplies, bound to the same
 * `apiClient.request()` transport `POST /api/insights/ask` uses. That is not a
 * style preference: the SDK's `servingEndpoints.query()` and AppKit's
 * `serving()` plugin both rebuild the request body from an allowlist that has
 * no `custom_inputs`, which silently disables plan approval while every request
 * still returns 200. A second transport here would reintroduce exactly that,
 * one route further from the guards that exist to catch it, so
 * benchmark-runner.test.ts sweeps this file's source and fails if a client
 * appears in it.
