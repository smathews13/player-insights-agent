/**
 * Whether the person reading the Connections page can reach the things this
 * deployment is wired to.
 *
 * WHY THE APP ASKS AND NOT THE AGENT. The orchestrator used to answer this from
 * inside the serving endpoint, and it stopped: every current model version
 * replies `preflight_retired` and carries its configuration instead of a health
 * report. `/api/preflight` reports that retirement correctly and says, in its own
 * assumption line, where the answer now lives -- "Unity Catalog and the
 * workspace, which hold the grants". Nothing then went and asked them. So the
 * page kept its promise to report "whether it can reach each one" while every
 * row but two read `Not checked`, which is the shape of an unkept promise rather
 * than of a limitation: a reader cannot tell a page that could not find out from
 * a page that never looked.
 *
 * WHAT A PASS HERE ACTUALLY MEANS, because this is the whole risk of adding it.
 * Each probe is a metadata GET against the control plane under the SIGNED-IN
 * USER's forwarded token. It establishes that this identity can see this object.
 * It does not establish that a query against it will succeed: row filters and
 * column masks are enforced at read time and are invisible to a metadata call,
 * `CAN_VIEW` on a serving endpoint is a different grant from `CAN_QUERY`, and a
 * Genie space a person can open can still be backed by tables they cannot read.
 * Every subject below therefore carries its own `proves` clause naming the gap,
 * and it is appended to the detail of a PASS rather than kept for the failures,
 * because an unqualified green tick is the reassuring lie this page exists to
 * refuse.
 *
 * THREE OUTCOMES, NOT TWO. A refusal (403) and an absence (404) are both
 * failures and are not the same failure: one is fixed with a GRANT and the other
 * cannot be, and reporting an absent table as forbidden sends a deployer to an
 * admin for a permission on an object that does not exist. Anything that did not
 * produce an answer at all -- a timeout, a 5xx, a rate limit, a missing token --
 * is `unverified`, which is this codebase's word for "nobody established it
 * either way" and is never rendered as health.
 *
 * A 403 IS NOT ONE FAILURE EITHER, and that is the correction this file most
 * recently needed. Three different things produce it, and they are fixed by
 * three different people:
 *
 *   the caller lacks a Unity Catalog grant   an admin runs a GRANT
 *   the caller's TOKEN lacks the API scope   the app declares it and is restarted
 *   the object is not there                  nobody grants anything (see 404)
 *
 * The middle one is the whole of `see {@link refusalCause}`. These probes run on
 * the signed-in user's FORWARDED token, which Databricks Apps downscopes to the
 * app's declared `user_api_scopes`. A scope the app never asked for makes every
 * call in that API family fail with a 403 that has nothing to do with the
 * reader's permissions, and this page reported all of them as missing grants and
 * printed a `GRANT SELECT` for each -- to a reader who could query every one of
 * those tables from a notebook. A confident wrong remedy is worse than none: it
 * is the one thing on this page a reader acts on.

 * stopping this recurring, because the failure it is guarding against is
 * somebody adding a probe against a new API and nobody noticing the app never
 * asked for the scope until a customer sees twenty red rows.
 *
 * THE NAMES ARE THE APPS ONES, NOT THE OAUTH SERVER'S. Two namespaces overlap
 * here and only one governs `user_api_scopes`. The workspace's OAuth metadata
 * (`/oidc/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`) advertises coarse families --
 * `unity-catalog`, `vector-search`, `genie` -- and the Apps update API rejects
 * `unity-catalog` outright while accepting `dashboards.genie`, which that
 * metadata does not list at all. The two lists disagree in BOTH directions, so
 * neither can be read off the other. Declaring `unity-catalog` here failed the
 * whole bundle deploy: "The specified scope unity-catalog is not a valid scope."
 *
 * Every name below was checked against the Apps API itself. See
 * `user-api-scopes.test.ts` for the one-line check, which needs no deploy.
 *
 * NO COARSE FALLBACK, DELIBERATELY. A probe against, say,
 * `/api/2.1/unity-catalog/volumes/` matches nothing here and reports '', which
 * fails `user-api-scopes.test.ts` on the commit that adds it. A general
 * `/api/2.1/unity-catalog/` entry would instead hand it a plausible scope that
 * does not cover the call, and the failure would surface on a customer's screen.
 *
 * Longest prefix wins, so a more specific family can be added above a general
 * one without the general one swallowing it.
