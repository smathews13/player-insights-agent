/**
 * The read side of Monitoring: every question anyone asked, and one question in
 * full.
 *
 * WHAT THESE ROUTES DO NOT DO. They do not decide who may call them. The admin
 * guard is owned elsewhere and is passed in at registration, and
 * {@link setupMonitoringRoutes} refuses to register a single route without one.
 * That is deliberate: a guard with a default is a guard somebody forgets to pass,
 * and the failure is silent and serves everybody's conversations to everybody.
 *
 * WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM. Questions and answers are stored messages.
 * Outcomes are the run ledger's terminal state, falling back to the stored
 * trace for questions asked before the ledger existed. Ratings are feedback
 * rows. Tables read are the fully-qualified names the agent recorded on each
 * answer as its sources. Nothing here computes a figure from anything else, and
 * nothing here has a placeholder: where a value was not recorded the field is
 * null and the page says so in words.
 *
 * THE LEDGER IS READ SEPARATELY AND MAY FAIL. `${APP_SCHEMA}.runs` is created
 * by a DDL statement that a database can legitimately refuse when the app's role
 * does not own the schema, so joining it into the main query would make an
 * absent ledger take the whole page down. It is a second read, and its failure
 * costs the outcome precision the trace fallback cannot provide rather than
 * costing the page.

/**
 * Questions in a range, with the answer that followed each and how it was rated.
 *
 * `$1` is the plan-approval sentinel, which is a stored user message and is not a
 * question anybody asked. `$2` and `$3` bound the range. `$4` is one more than
 * the requested page size, `$5` optionally scopes to one person, `$6`/`$7` are
 * the keyset cursor, and `$8` is question-or-asker search.
 *
 * An answer is an assistant message that CARRIES A TRACE, which is the same
 * definition `RUNS_QUERY` uses in insights-routes.ts, and the reason this reads
 * the way it does. A conversation that went through plan approval stores three
 * assistant turns: the proposed plan, then the answer. The plan carries no
 * trace. Walking forward from the question to the first assistant message
 * therefore landed on the plan and called it the answer, which is how a run with
 * a recorded duration, seven tool calls and a rating came back with none of the
 * three: they are on the answer, and this was reading the plan. Rows that did
 * show a time were the conversations that skipped approval, so nothing looked
 * uniformly broken.
 *
 * The pairing runs BACKWARD from the answer for the same reason `RUNS_QUERY`
 * does: the approval turn is a stored user message, so the last user message
 * before an answer is the approval rather than the question unless the sentinel
 * in `$1` is skipped. Going backward also stops an unanswered question from
 * adopting the next question's answer, which a forward walk bounded only by time
 * would have done.
 *
 * `answers` has no upper time bound because an answer can land after the range
 * ends for a question asked just inside it, and that answer is still this
 * question's. The lower bound holds because an answer cannot precede its
 * question.
 *
 * The feedback row is the ASKER'S own, scoped by their email rather than the
 * reading admin's. That is the one deliberate difference from `RUNS_QUERY`,
 * which scopes to the caller because a reader there is looking at their own
 * runs. An admin reading someone else's question wants the rating that person
 * gave, and scoping to the admin would have shown "not rated" for every row.
 *
 * ── THE ALL-TIME RANGE, AND HOW IT STOPPED BEING QUADRATIC ──
 *
 * This query used to be quadratic in the number of rows in the range, and an
 * all-time window reached it. The cause was structural rather than a missing
 * index: an `answers` CTE computed each answer's `question_id` with a correlated
 * scalar subquery, and the join was on the RESULT of that computation
 * (`WHERE a2.question_id = q.question_id`). A scalar subquery result is not a
 * column, so no index could ever serve that predicate, and Postgres had to
 * evaluate the pairing once per question in the range.
 *
 * It is now paired in the other direction, which is what makes an all-time
 * window cost what a day costs:
 *
 *   1. `page` takes the newest `$4` questions in the range and nothing else.
 *      `messages_created_at_idx` serves that directly, walked backward, and it
 *      stops as soon as the page is full. Nothing here reads an answer.
 *   2. For each of those (at most `$4`) questions, two INDEXED lookups on
 *      `(conversation_id, created_at)`, which is what
 *      `messages_conversation_created_idx` (added 2026-08-16, see
 *      `schemaStatements` in insights-routes.ts) exists for: where the next
 *      question in that conversation is, and the first traced answer before it.
 *
 * So the answer-side work is bounded by the PAGE, whatever the window. The one
 * part still proportional to the range is `range_totals`, deliberately: see its
 * note below.
 *
 * ── THE PAIRING RULE IS UNCHANGED, AND IT IS THE PART TO BE CAREFUL WITH ──
 *
 * The rule is still exactly what `RUNS_QUERY` uses and what the recorded pairing
 * bugs above were fixed to: an answer belongs to the LAST non-sentinel user
 * message at or before it. Expressed forward, that is a traced assistant message
 * at or after the question and STRICTLY BEFORE the next non-sentinel user
 * message in the conversation -- because if another question had landed in
 * between, the answer would belong to that one.
 *
 * WHICH of the window's messages is the answer was the third pairing bug. It was
 * the FIRST, and on an approved-plan turn the window holds the proposed plan as
 * well as the answer, so Monitoring served the plan's trace: no `totalMs`, no
 * `toolCalls`, blank Time and Tools on a run whose figures Run Explorer was
 * showing on the next tab. It is now the message that carries the figures, which
 * is the turn's final answer. Two surfaces do not make different claims about
 * one fact; see D13 in bundle/DECISIONS.md.
 *
 * The `< COALESCE(next question, 'infinity')` bound is therefore not an
 * optimisation, it is the pairing rule. Remove it and an unanswered question
 * adopts the next question's answer, which is one of the two bugs above.
 *
 * `m.created_at >= q.asked_at` replaces the old `m.created_at >= $2` and is
 * strictly tighter and per question. Note what is still absent: NO upper bound
 * at `$3`. An answer can land after the range ends for a question asked just
 * inside it, and that answer is still this question's.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE TOTALS COST, AND WHY THEY ARE IN HERE ──
 *
 * `range_totals` counts the range's questions and distinct conversation threads,
 * and lists its askers. It was two further round
 * trips (`MONITORING_TOTALS_QUERY` and `MONITORING_PEOPLE_QUERY`, both deleted),
 * folded in here so a Monitoring refresh is one statement rather than three.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT a window function over the page, though the plan called
 * for one. `COUNT(*) OVER ()` after a `LIMIT` counts the PAGE, and the whole
 * reason these totals exist is to be the range's real figures when the page is
 * truncated -- a window function would have quietly turned "2000 of 40000
 * questions" into "2000 of 2000". `COUNT(DISTINCT ...) OVER ()` is not
 * implemented in Postgres at all. So they are a one-row aggregate CTE joined
 * onto the page, which is the same single round trip and the correct numbers.
 *
 * They stay proportional to the range, and that is the accepted cost of an exact
 * denominator: an index range scan and a hash aggregate, no answers read and no
 * jsonb touched. The expensive half was never the counting.
 *
 * MEASURE BEFORE CHANGING ANY OF IT. Two pairing bugs are recorded above, one of
 * which served a plan's trace as the answer's. Do NOT fetch credentials and
 * explain it against the deployed branch from a laptop: a local process holding
 * a connection to that branch is how tables came to be owned by the wrong role
 * and blocked a release.
 *
 * See section 5.8 of the admin Monitoring and Ops plan for all of it.
