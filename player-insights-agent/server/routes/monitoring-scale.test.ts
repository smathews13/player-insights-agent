/**
 * The Monitoring list over a store the size the demo is heading for.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The all-time range was unsafe. The statement it used to
 * send (kept below as {@link OLD_QUESTIONS_QUERY}, lifted verbatim from the
 * commit before this one) built EVERY question in the range and EVERY traced
 * answer from the range's start onward, ran a back-scan per answer to find its
 * question, extracted jsonb from all of it, and only then applied the page's
 * `LIMIT`. Work was proportional to the store, so the page got slower every day
 * the demo was used, and "all time" was the range where that bill came due.
 *
 * WHAT IS MEASURED HERE, PRECISELY -- read this before quoting a number from it.
 * There is no Postgres and no pglite in this sandbox and the package registry is
 * unreachable, so this cannot be, and does not claim to be, a measurement of
 * Postgres executing the statement. What it does measure, honestly:
 *
 *  - The REAL route, the REAL statement text, and the real row shaping, ledger
 *    read, totals handling and response building, end to end, wall clock.
 *  - The ACCESS PATTERN the statement forces on a 100,000-message store, by
 *    executing that statement's own predicates and bounds against an indexed
 *    in-memory store that counts every row it is made to look at.
 *
 * The second is the part that generalises to Postgres, because the thing that
 * made the old page unsafe was not a constant factor -- it was that the number
 * of rows touched tracked the store rather than the page. Both statements are
 * run through the same executor over the same 100k rows, so the comparison at
 * the bottom is like for like: the old one is made to touch the whole store, the
 * new one touches the page.
 *
 * SO: quote the wall clock as "the app-side path is not the cost", and quote the
 * rows-examined figures as the proof about scale. A true Postgres timing needs
 * a reachable Postgres; see the report that accompanied this change.
