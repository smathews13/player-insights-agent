/**
 * The roster, read and edited by this deployment's super administrator.
 *
 * One endpoint family, `/api/users`, and it is super-admin-only through the prefix
 * list in admin-roles.ts rather than through a guard written here. Nothing in this
 * file checks a role: the middleware has already refused a consumer AND a plain
 * administrator with 403 by the time a handler runs, and a second check here would
 * be a second place for the answer to be wrong.
 *
 * EVERY CHANGE TAKES EFFECT WITHOUT A REDEPLOY, which is the entire point of the
 * file. The role is a row in Lakebase, read on the next request by resolveRole, so
 * a person appointed here holds the role before the reply reaches the browser.
 *
 * A PROMOTION IS ONE ACTION: A ROW IN LAKEBASE. It used to be two, because a
 * promotion also granted Unity Catalog read on the telemetry schema and the
 * `system.billing` tables. That is gone. Granting on `system` needs an account
 * admin who is also a metastore admin, so the ordinary outcome was a
 * PERMISSION_DENIED beside the name of the person just promoted, for read access
 * the rank never required. Somebody who needs to read billing gets that from a
 * metastore admin, not from this screen.
 *
 * A DEMOTION STILL HANDS BACK what earlier versions of this app granted, best
 * effort, under the acting super admin's own forwarded token. That is recorded in
 * the audit trail rather than on screen, and it never refuses the role change.
 *
 * WHAT THE RANK GRANTS is no data at all. A question runs under the asker's own
 * grants at every rank, and a super admin reading somebody else's conversation in
 * Monitoring sees what their own grants allow -- appointing themselves does not
 * change that by one column.
