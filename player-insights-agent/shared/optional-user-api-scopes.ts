/**
 * OAuth scopes that improve Connections / Ops metadata probes and the
 * Connections pickers, but are not required for asks (Genie's SQL / serving
 * path).
 *
 * Always listed in the login gate and Identity card as Optional so a reader can
 * see the capability without treating a shortfall as a hard gate. As of
 * 2026-08-18 they are in the SHARED DEFAULT, so a customer/T2 deploy requests
 * them too (not just example); "optional" here means the login gate does not fail
 * when the workspace cannot issue one, NOT that the deploy declines to ask. A
 * deployment may still drop them from its own override, and the gate stays
 * neutral either way.
 *
 * The Vector Search browse pair joined this set on Sam's 2026-08-18 call, in the
 * shared default alongside catalog/workspace and optional for the login gate:
 * they let the Connections pickers enumerate VS endpoints and indexes, and
 * without them a reader types the name instead. This governs only the APP's
 * forwarded token. Ask-time semantic retrieval runs on the MODEL's own
 * downscoped token, whose UserAuthPolicy (agent/semantic_retrieval.py) still
 * requires Vector Search on a semantic deployment -- a different token, a
 * different validator, unaffected by this list. And the honest caveat that no
 * classification here can soften: Apps consent is all-or-nothing, so a workspace
 * that will not issue one of these fails the whole sign-in ahead of the app;
 * "optional" is about our gate's verdict, not the platform's issuance.
 *
 * `postgres` joined later the same day for Lakebase project/branch/database
 * browse on Connections. It is the Apps name for the Lakebase family (the bare
 * control-plane paths sit under `/api/2.0/postgres/`), and without it the
 * picker falls back to typing the full database resource name. It is NOT an
 * MLflow substitute: Apps still has no MLflow scope at all.
