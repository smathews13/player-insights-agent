/**
 * Which of a run's steps are allowed to decide the run's own verdict.
 *
 * A run is stored as an answer with a list of stages, and the verdict the reader
 * meets -- the pill in the conversation rail, the status column in the Run
 * Explorer, the word in the run header -- has always been the worst status any
 * stage ended on. That rule is right for the steps that produce the answer and
 * wrong for one of them, and the exception is the whole reason this module
 * exists.
 *
 * THE CHART STEP IS NOT PART OF THE ANSWER. It runs after the narrative and the
 * figures are already assembled, from the rows the run had already read, and it
 * draws a panel on top of them. A chart that was declined, refused as malformed
 * or never rendered because the plotting endpoint was down costs a picture; the
 * answer above it, its figures, its sources and its SQL are all intact and
 * checkable. Letting that outcome set the verdict published a correct answer as
 * a degraded one, which is worse than a missing panel in two ways: the reader
 * distrusts figures that are fine, and 'partial' stops meaning anything once
 * the commonest cause of it is cosmetic.
 *
 * THE STEP'S OWN STATUS IS UNTOUCHED. `agent.py` still reports what the
 * plotting step did and why -- amber for a spec it would not render, green for a
 * decline -- and the trace timeline still draws it. This is only about what may
 * be aggregated UPWARDS. A reader who opens the run sees the honest step; a
 * reader who does not, sees a verdict about the answer.
 *
 * ONE RULE, TWO EVALUATORS, and that is the hazard this file is written against.
 * The verdict is computed in Postgres by `RUNS_QUERY`, because it is derived
 * from stored JSON at query time rather than written to a column, and the same
 * rule is applied in TypeScript by anything holding stages in memory. Both read
 * `VERDICT_EXEMPT_STAGE_IDS` from here so a step added to the exemption is added
 * once. The SQL is built from this constant rather than restating it.
 */

 * Stage ids whose outcome must never become the run's verdict.
 *
 * Matched on the stage ID rather than its name, which is prose somebody will
 * reword -- the same discipline `RUNS_QUERY` already applies to the `cap` stage
 * it reads truncation from. `plot` is the id `agent.py` emits for the charting
 * step; see the `yield log.stage("plot", ...)` call there.
 *
