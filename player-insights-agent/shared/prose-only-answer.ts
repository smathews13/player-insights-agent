/**
 * What the ask route serves when the agent replied in prose and nothing else.
 *
 * THIS USED TO BE THE DEMO ANSWER WITH NEW WORDS ON TOP. The endpoint returns a
 * text output item and no result contract, the route kept the agent's sentences
 * and filled the figures, charts, sources, SQL and stage timings from the app's
 * own stored demo answer, then labelled the whole thing `provenance: 'mixed'`
 * with a caveat saying which half was borrowed. Both labels were accurate and
 * neither was a control: the numbers were still on the screen, underneath a
 * narrative about the reader's own business, and a reader who has been told the
 * figures are illustrative still reads the figure. It is the same finding
 * `agent/tools.py` records about Genie prose, and the same one that made an
 * identity refusal readable as an answer with the demo dataset attached.
 *
 * So there is no scaffold now. The prose is kept, because it is the agent's own
 * work and the reader asked for it, and everything that would have been
 * invented around it is empty.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT `NO_VALID_EVIDENCE`. That code means a run read nothing it
 * was allowed to use, and the agent is the only thing that can observe it:
 * `agent.py` replaces the body with its own unanswered text when
 * `no_evidence_survived` and returns a normal result contract, which reaches the
 * route as a structured answer and never comes near here. A prose reply tells
 * this app one thing only, which is that no result contract arrived. Reporting
 * that as an evidence failure would be a surface asserting a finding it did not
 * make, which is the class of bug this workstream is removing rather than a new
 * instance of it.

 * become caveats, and drops everything else -- the `## DATA PACKAGE` heading,
 * the sources roll-call, the columns inventory, the handoff note, and the
 * scratchpad the model writes above the heading while it decides what to do.
 * Every path in the agent that hands a package to a card runs it through that.
 *
 * THIS PATH DID NOT, because it is not in the agent. When the endpoint streams
 * prose and no result contract ever arrives, the route wraps whatever text came
 * back and serves it as the answer. On a run that ended in the finder, "whatever
 * text came back" is the package, verbatim: a reader got "This question was not
 * answered." as the headline and then the model's own working notes underneath
 * it -- "Sources used", "Columns assessed", "Package note: Optional detail was
 * clipped at the DSF handoff bound" -- which reads as the answer, and reads as an
 * answer that contradicts its own headline.
 *
 * So the same split, in the same shape, on this side of the wire. The section
 * names are the agent's and are deliberately duplicated rather than imported:
 * this is a TypeScript server and that is a Python module, and the alternative
