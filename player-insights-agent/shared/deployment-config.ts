/**
 * THE set of things this deployment is connected to, and what it takes to change
 * each one.
 *
 *   - App settings arrive as environment variables in the app container, written
 *     into the deployed app.yaml by scripts/deploy-app-yaml.mjs at release time.
 *     An app redeploy changes them.
 *   - Player Insights Agent model settings are BAKED INTO THE MLFLOW MODEL ARTIFACT at log
 *     time, by `mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(model_config=...)`. Nothing the app can
 *     write reaches them. The Genie space ids and the catalog the served agent
 *     actually uses live in that artifact, and only a new model version changes
 *     them.
 *
 * Nothing in the app can apply a served-agent setting. The pane can STAGE one,
 * recording the value the deployer intends, and reports it as staged rather
 * than active until a model version carries it; `applyWith` is the command that
 * closes that gap. `stageable` and `changedBy` are separate fields so staging
 * cannot be mistaken for applying.
