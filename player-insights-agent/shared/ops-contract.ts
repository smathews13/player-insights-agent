/**
 * What the three Ops blocks answer with, declared once for both sides.
 *
 * The Ops tab is three blocks that load, fail and timestamp separately: health,
 * cost, traffic. That independence is the whole design, and it is the reason
 * this file declares three payloads rather than one. A single `OpsPayload`
 * would be filled by a single route, a single route is a single failure, and a
 * slow billing query would then hold up the block that says whether the
 * warehouse is answering. The types are separate so that arrangement cannot be
 * arrived at by accident.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE. Every figure on Ops carries the quality
 * of its own measurement, and the quality travels WITH the number rather than
 * being decided by whichever component draws it. A tile is `{ amount,
 * quality }`, not a number the page labels afterwards, because a label applied
 * at the call site is a label that can be forgotten at the next call site. This
 * app has already shipped one panel that promised figures it discarded and one
 * summary line counting something other than the rows beneath it; both were
 * possible because the number and the claim about it lived apart.
