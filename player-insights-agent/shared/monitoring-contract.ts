/**
 * What Monitoring reads, and the two classifications the server and the browser
 * have to agree about.
 *
 * Shared rather than declared twice because both classifications are the kind
 * that drift silently. The first is the outcome of a question: answered,
 * refused, or failed. The second is the cause of a refusal: a grant somebody can
 * make, versus a rule this release enforces on itself. Both are derived from the
 * failure taxonomy's LAYER rather than from a list of codes, so a code added
 * there lands in the right bucket without anybody remembering to come here.
 *
 * WHY REFUSED AND FAILED ARE NEVER ONE NUMBER. A refusal is the app working:
 * somebody asked for data they are not entitled to and was told so. A failure is
 * the app not working. Added together they produce a figure that rises for two
 * unrelated reasons and can be reduced by fixing either, which is the same as
 * measuring nothing. Every shape in this file keeps them apart, and nothing here
 * exposes a sum of the two.
