/**
 * Which rows can honestly be given a reachability verdict, and which cannot.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PINS. `Not checked` used to be decided by `agentKey`, which
 * records who OWNS a value rather than whether anything is on the other end of
 * it. So three orchestrator settings that name no object anywhere -- the answer
 * length limit and both catalog pattern lists -- sat permanently under a heading
 * promising a reachability verdict that no check could ever deliver, and two more
 * did it whenever they were legitimately unset.
 *
 * The registry declares it now, per resource, and these assert both halves: that
 * every entry states its answer, and that the answer produces the badge a reader
 * can act on.
