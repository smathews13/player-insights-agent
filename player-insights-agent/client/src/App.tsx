 * lands on, so splitting it would put a network round trip in front of the one
 * route that must be instant. Connections is linked from every page, but a link
 * is still an explicit navigation and its large diagnostics surface should not
 * be paid for by an Ask-only visit. Settings is split at the click in Layout.
 *
 * These five are the opposite case. Monitoring and Ops are behind `AdminOnly`,
 * which renders nothing for a consumer -- so the import below is never even
 * requested for most readers -- and Run Explorer, Architecture and the Benchmark
 * Lab are each a page somebody opens on purpose, having already waited for the
 * app to load once.
 *
 * Named exports, hence the `.then`: `lazy` wants a module whose `default` is the
 * component, and nothing in this client uses default exports for pages.
 *
 * BenchmarkLab is referenced here BY PATH ONLY and its contents are somebody
 * else's work in flight; this file must not be the reason that file changes.
