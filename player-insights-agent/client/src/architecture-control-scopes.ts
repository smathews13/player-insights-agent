/**
 * Which runtime bound governs which part of the live architecture drawing.
 *
 * THIS IS AN ENFORCEMENT MAP, NOT A VISUAL GROUPING. The three scopes overlap
 * because the three server brakes do: one finder step asks the model what to do,
 * admitted tool calls happen inside those steps, and the request deadline wraps
 * both plus synthesis. A node belongs here only when the agent code checks that
 * bound before using it, or when it is the infrastructure immediately behind a
 * checked call. Keeping the map as data lets the render tests name every included
 * and excluded node rather than accepting a plausible-looking halo.
 *
 * Edge keys use the architecture model's `from->to` identity rather than the
 * drawing's `peN` ids. The latter are DOM handles; the former say what operation
 * is bounded and survive a reroute.
