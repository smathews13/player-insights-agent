/**
 * How much reading the access check asks for before it lets somebody in.
 *
 * This screen is the first thing any reader meets and the only thing standing
 * between them and the app, and it had grown into a wall: a five-line opening
 * paragraph, four more paragraphs of refusal above the list of refusals, an amber
 * panel of caveats with a three-line explanation under each one, and three action
 * buttons carrying three lines apiece. Every sentence in it was true and most were
 * load-bearing somewhere, which is exactly how it happened.
 *
 * SO THESE ARE LENGTH ASSERTIONS, deliberately. Nothing else stops prose growing
 * back one defensible sentence at a time. The facts themselves are pinned in
 * `access-gate-copy.test.ts`; what is pinned here is that each of them is said
 * once, in a bounded number of words, with the rest behind a disclosure.
 *
 * Rendered rather than read from source, because the count line is computed and
 * the collapsed caveats have to be collapsed in markup rather than in intent.
 * Nothing here says anything about pixels.
