/**
 * The composer's paperclip, which worked and said nothing about working.
 *
 * The decision is asserted as a function because the app's tests run without a
 * DOM, and the states are asserted against composer.css for the reason
 * answer-geometry.test.ts and palette.test.ts do the same: they are painted
 * pixels in a repo with no browser, so what this buys is that the rules exist
 * and that a later restyle which quietly drops one fails here. It cannot prove
 * any of them look right, and nothing below should be read as saying anyone has
 * seen them.
 *
 * The state that matters most is the one in the middle. A file being read,
 * uploaded and parsed is seconds of work on a PDF, and for the whole of it this
 * control was indistinguishable from a control at rest -- so pressing it again
 * was the reasonable response, and pressing it again starts a second
 * `uploadAttachments` over the same `<input>` element, whose `value` the first
 * one clears on its way out.
