 * The geometry, checked arithmetically because it cannot be checked visually.
 *
 * No browser runs here, so nothing in this repository can see the diagram. What
 * can be established without one is that the layout is internally consistent:
 * every node is placed, no two cards occupy the same space, every edge starts and
 * ends on the two cards it claims to join, and no caption is placed where a card
 * will be drawn over it. That is not the same as "it looks right" -- a human still
 * has to open it -- but it does catch the ways this kind of layout actually
 * breaks.
 *
 * THE CARD HEIGHTS USED TO BE OUT OF SCOPE HERE, and that is what let the tab
 * ship with its cards on top of one another. A single NODE_HEIGHT_ESTIMATE of 140
 * stood in for all twelve, the columns were stacked on a 160px pitch, and the
 * real cards are 157 to 229 -- so every check in this file agreed with itself
 * while the Data Genie space card was drawn underneath the Dictionary card and
 * lost its title. The heights are derived per card now, from the same stylesheet
 * this file reads its other arithmetic out of, and the check that two rectangles
 * do not intersect is at the bottom.
