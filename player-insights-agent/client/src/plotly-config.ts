/*
 * ---- Presentation, applied to a copy of the spec at draw time ----
 *
 * A chart spec is written by the agent and stored beside the answer, so every colour
 * in it is a STATIC LIGHT-THEME LITERAL: ink #161616 on the labels, #EBEBEB on the
 * gridlines, white behind the tooltip. Those were correct when this app had one
 * theme. On the night sky they are a figure drawn in near-black on near-black, with a
 * white tooltip flaring out of it, and no amount of stylesheet can reach inside an
 * SVG Plotly draws from a JavaScript object.
 *
 * So the theme is resolved HERE, at the moment of drawing, off the same custom
 * properties every other surface reads. Two rules govern everything below:
 *
 *   1. THE ANSWER'S DATA IS NEVER TOUCHED. `themedFigure` deep-copies both halves of
 *      the spec and writes only into the copy. `answer.charts` is shared with the
 *      transcript, the Run Explorer's stage detail and whatever is persisted, and a
 *      figure that repainted its own input would leave a light-theme chart holding
 *      dark-theme colours the moment it was drawn twice.
 *   2. NOTHING HERE INVENTS A FACT. Points, labels, hover text, category order and
 *      series names are carried across verbatim. What this file may change is how a
 *      thing is painted -- a colour, a stroke width, an opacity -- and the two
 *      enhancements that are more than paint (an area fill under a line, a marker on
 *      its peak) are each gated on the incoming figure already being unambiguously
 *      that shape. An arbitrary scatter of two measures against each other has a
 *      largest y value and no "peak", and a chart that labelled one would be
 *      inventing a claim the agent did not make.

 * palette by value, and mapping slot for slot is what lets the token layer move a
 * series colour -- as the dark theme already moves `--chart-1` and `--chart-3` -- and
 * have the charts follow.
 *
 * THERE WERE THREE, AND THE AGENT EMITS FOUR. A fourth category is the neutral
