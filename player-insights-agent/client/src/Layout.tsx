            with the Benchmark Lab experiment on -- seven for everybody while
            `SHOW_EVERY_TAB_TO_EVERYONE` is on. The breakpoint stays whatever
            the count is: below it the nav and the brand alone over-subscribe the
            header, which squeezed the identity chips to zero width and pushed
            the gear off the right edge. The sheet below carries the same links,
            from the same component, at those widths. Tying the breakpoint to the
            count would mean the header collapsed at a different width for two
            people looking at the same deployment.

            Six tabs do not over-subscribe it, but they leave the chips much less
            room than four did, so responsive.css takes 4px off each side of every
            tab in the 1180-1365 band -- the same band where the chip already
            sheds its label because the header is tight. Where the row starts is
            the rail-width of `.brand-lockup`, not a first-tab padding exception.

            Which width that is now lives in responsive.css with the other three,
            rather than in a `xl:` utility here. The two systems disagreed: the nav
            collapsed at Tailwind's 1280 while the trace inspector had already gone
            at the hand-written 1180, so there was a 100px band in which the header
            was full and the page had lost a column. One set of breakpoints now --
            480, 800, 1180, 1366 -- and the nav goes at 1180 with the inspector. */}

            This pointed at `/connections` for as long as the gear existed, on
            the argument that Connections was already the settings surface: it
            reads and writes `/api/settings`, and nobody looking for settings
            looks for "Connections". The argument was wrong about what a gear
            promises. A gear says "your preferences", and landing on a page of
            catalogs, warehouses and endpoint ids reads as a mis-click, which is
            the complaint this control kept attracting.

            So there are two surfaces, split by what they configure. `/settings`
            holds app behavior and appearance in the deployment's Lakebase store.
            Connections holds external resources, deployment reporting, identity
            and permission evidence. Appearance is caller-scoped; Connections
            describes what the deployment can reach.

            Neutral by construction. `ghost` and `text-muted-foreground` are
            tokens rather than hues, so it comes through a repaint of the
            palette without a second edit.

            Named "App settings" rather than "Settings" so it is not a substring
            of anything nearby: "the button called Settings" would otherwise be
            an ambiguous locator the moment a settings word appears in the nav,
            which is how the delete control broke four tests this morning. The
            page it opens is titled "App settings" for the same reason, and
            settings is deliberately still not a nav entry.

            AVAILABLE TO EVERY RESOLVED SIGNED-IN USER. Consumers can edit their
            own Appearance preferences; privileged panes stay hidden or disabled
            inside Settings.

            IT IS HANDED TO THE CLUSTER RATHER THAN PLACED AFTER IT. It used to be
            the header's last child, which drew it past the attribution at the far
            right -- so a control belonging to the reader sat on the far side of the
            divider whose job is to separate the reader from who built the app. It
            now goes between the identity chip and that divider, which is where
            HEADER_CLUSTER_ORDER records it, and only the header's copy of the
            cluster is given one: the mobile sheet's copy is passed nothing, so
            "App settings" names exactly one element at any width. */}
