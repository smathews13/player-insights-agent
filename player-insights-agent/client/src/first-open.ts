/**
 * What the login gate shows on first open: the identity the session runs under,
 * the app's required OAuth scopes one row at a time, and the disclaimer.
 *
 * Built to `login-gate.md`. Where that spec and the mockup beside it disagreed,
 * the spec won and the difference is noted at the line it affects.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT THE ACCESS GATE. `AccessGate.tsx` runs a probe under the
 * reader's own token and reports it per table, per Genie space, with a remedy
 * against each; it is switched off in `shared/access-gate.ts` because that report
 * was found confusing in front of a demo. This asks the workspace nothing. Every
 * fact below is already on the `/api/identity` payload the header reads on load.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS A SECOND OPINION. The scope comparison is
 * `server/lib/session-freshness.ts`, which reuses `tokenCarriesScope` because the
 * forwarded token spells our catalog reads `unity-catalog` while the bundle has
 * to spell them `catalog.tables:read`. A second copy of that mapping is a second
 * chance to read a token that carries a scope as one that lacks it, and that
 * confusion has printed a GRANT for a present scope once already.
 *
 * THE REQUIRED SET IS READ, NEVER WRITTEN DOWN HERE, which the spec asks for in
 * as many words. `declaredScopes` on the report is `PLAYER_INSIGHTS_USER_API_SCOPES`.
 * A source-only Git artifact gets the four universal ask-path scopes from
 * app.yaml; a bundle release replaces that fallback with the App resource's exact
 * target-layered declaration. A literal list in this UI would drift from both.
 * It would also drift from the platform's own spelling, and the `:read` suffix is
 * live enough to be worth naming: the app declares
 * `vectorsearch.vector-search-indexes:read`, with the suffix, while the design
 * mockup shows it without. Reading the list is what stops this screen taking a
 * side in that.
