 *

 * still-picture renderer. It is loaded the same way (a dynamic import reached only
 * when a download runs) so it never lands in the eager graph either. Both go through
 * the shared, reviewed presentation pass in plotly-config.ts; neither invents paint.

/**
 * Everything interactive the notebook has, and nothing that fights a chat transcript.
 *
 * Exported because the read-only half of it is the point and not a detail. An answer
 * is a record of what the agent found, and a figure whose labels can be typed over is
 * not evidence of anything. `chart-read-only.test.ts` asserts this object, so the
 * guarantee survives a rewrite of how the plot is mounted.
 *
 * Config is also the whole of the control surface: which parts of a figure accept a
 * keystroke lives on Plotly's context, never in `layout`, so nothing the agent sends
 * can reopen what is closed here.
