/**
 * The two complaints this page came back with, held apart so neither fix can
 * quietly undo the other.
 *
 * The first was that a page promising to report "whether it can reach each one"
 * answered `Not checked` down almost its whole length, because the orchestrator
 * retired its dependency report and nothing took the job over. The second was
 * that the Refresh button appeairon frontier: it had no pending state, and on a
 * healthy deployment every answer comes back identical, so pressing it changed
 * nothing a person could see.
 *
 * What is asserted here is the READING and the CONTROL, not the probes -- the
 * classifier has its own tests next to it, and the point of these is that an
 * answer the workspace gave reaches the badge, the diagram and the headline
 * without any of the three interpreting it privately.
 *
 * Read against source for the parts a browser would otherwise have to confirm,
 * in the pattern architecture-coupling.test.ts established: this repo has no
 * jsdom, and the claims that genuinely need one are named in the handover
 * rather than asserted as though they had been.
