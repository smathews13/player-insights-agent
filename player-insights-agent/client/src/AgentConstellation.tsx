/**
 * The run's steps as a night sky, in the two arrangements the design draws.
 *
 * `AgentPathConstellation` is `#18a`: the rail's run, vertical, connecting as it
 * happens. The line into the step in progress draws on a 2.2s loop, that step's
 * star pulses, and a 16px face-button loader runs beside the foot's persistent
 * engraved D-pad identity; every other line is at rest.
 * IT STAYS UP AFTER THE RUN, at rest and with the ending named on its status
 * line, because the reader asked to keep looking at the drawing of the run they
 * just watched rather than have it substituted for a list the moment the answer
 * lands. Nothing about it animates then, the foot's mark included: `activeIndex`
 * is the caller's statement that a step is in progress, and -1 is the same caller
 * saying none is.
 *
 * `AgentMapConstellation` is `#18b`: the finished run, horizontal and scattered,
 * with each step's name and figures set opposite the line flow and the selected
 * star ringed and tinted.
 *
 * THE LIVE PATH SHIPS TWICE, AND THE THEME DECIDES WHICH ONE IS ON SCREEN.
 * `#18a`'s night sky is the dark theme's account of a run. Light mode is daylight
 * all the way through -- no sky behind the answers, so no sky in the harness
 * either -- and a navy band with sparkle stars in it is the one thing on that page
 * that would still be night. `StepRail` below is the same run drawn as a list on
 * white: the same stages, the same numbers, the same selection, the same press.
 *
 * BOTH ARE ALWAYS IN THE MARKUP AND constellation.css SHOWS EXACTLY ONE. The
 * alternative was reading `data-theme` in JavaScript and mounting one of them,
 * which is a first render made against whatever the root said before the theme
 * had been applied -- a frame of the wrong variant on every open, and a second
 * frame of it every time Appearance previews a switch. A CSS selector has no
 * first render to be wrong on, and `display: none` keeps the hidden view out of
 * the accessibility tree, so neither variant's live region or step buttons can be
 * announced while the other one is the view.
 *
 * Every coordinate comes out of `agent-constellation.ts` and none is written here.
 * That is the same split the rest of this page uses -- vitest runs on `node`, so a
 * number that only exists as an attribute in JSX can be asserted against a
 * rendered tree and never against the arithmetic behind it -- and here it is also
 * what makes the overflow claim checkable: the geometry module derives every
 * position from the box, and its test reads them back and fails if anything lands
 * outside it at any step count.
 *
 * THE FINISHED MAP IS DECORATIVE; THE LIVE PATH IS INSPECTABLE. The map's band is
 * `aria-hidden` because the card grid underneath it owns selection. The path has no
 * duplicate card grid, so each star is a keyboard-operable step selector and the SVG
 * is named as the "Agent steps" group. Its status line is the one
 * `aria-live="polite"` region: "Step 07 · Preparing the findings · 12s", a sentence
 * about the run rather than a description of the animation. Elapsed time is the
 * caller's measured elapsed, never a percentage.
 *
 * `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` freezes all of it, in astrolabe-animation.css,
 * through the `ast-anim-*` class names this file uses. That guard also restores the
 * resting state each animation would otherwise be frozen mid-way into -- a drawn
 * line rather than an undrawn one -- which is why the classes are used rather than
 * an inline `animation`.
