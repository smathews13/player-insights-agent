/**
 * One answered turn: the takeaway, its supporting context, the evidence the

 *
 * Split out of App.tsx when the pages became modules. Ask PIA is its only
 * caller, and the card is the largest thing in the transcript, so it is the one
 * most worth being able to work on without holding the whole of Ask PIA open.
 *
 * The order of the sections below is the specification's and is argued for
 * there. It is not a layout preference: the fallback banner leads because it
 * governs how every number under it reads, Caveats follow Sources, and the run

            is a reader checking a chart against a table instead of reading either.

            So when this answer charted, the Markdown rows are FOLDED rather than
            dropped. Two things made folding necessary instead of the plain `else`
            this was:

            1. A chart can fail to draw -- a chunk that 404s after a redeploy, a
               spec Plotly refuses -- and the panel then said so into a card with
               no figures anywhere in it. The evidence was gone and the answer
               still read as answered. `chartsFailed` unfolds the rows.
            2. A plot summarises. The two-panel rule pairs a full series with a
               recent window, so the rows behind it can hold dates and values no
               panel plots. A reader who wants those had nowhere to go.

            Folded, so the card still reads as one piece of evidence. Reachable,
            so nothing the agent measured is only in a picture. */}

            forwarded to the endpoint and the model is logged with user
            authorization, so the warehouse enforces the reader's own grants. A
            footer naming a service principal told every reader the one thing
            about their answer this product exists to be trusted on, backwards.
            `dataAccessDisclosure` says what the run reported, and says nothing
            at all where nothing reported one: a run with no recorded identity
            is not a run to make any claim about, in either direction.

            Kept on its own line because access provenance is evidence about
            this run, not boilerplate about AI. */}
