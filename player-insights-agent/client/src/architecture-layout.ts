/**
 * Where each node sits, and how the edges get between them.
 *
 * A HAND-ROLLED LAYOUT IN PIXELS, on a canvas of a fixed size, computed here
 * rather than measured in the DOM. The client bundle is already over 500 kB and
 * Databricks Apps forbids runtime CDNs, so there is no graph library to reach
 * for; and a layout that measured itself would be untestable without running a
 * browser, which is the one thing this work cannot do.
 *
 * IT USED TO BE PERCENTAGES ON A 0-100 SQUARE, and the reason it is not any more
 * is that a percentage layout has no fixed relationship between a card's width in
 * `ch` and the gap the edge labels need. Cards grew with their content, edge
 * captions ended up underneath them, and the graph reflowed into overlapping
 * boxes at the exact widths a laptop is set to. The design this now implements
 * states the canvas as {@link CANVAS_WIDTH} x {@link CANVAS_HEIGHT} and places
 * every card and every path in that one space, so a caption that clears a card
 * here clears it at every viewport. Narrow viewports SCROLL the canvas rather
 * than re-arranging it -- see architecture.css -- because a diagram that
 * rearranges itself is a second diagram nobody checked.
 *
 * SCROLLING IS THE BEHAVIOUR AT NARROW WIDTHS AND WAS ALSO THE BEHAVIOUR AT WIDE
 * ONES. The canvas was 1400 across and the widest the panel around it ever gets
 * is {@link CANVAS_MAX_WIDTH}, so every reader at every window size got a
 * horizontal scrollbar and the right-hand column against the edge. Nothing here
 * caught it: every check compared the layout to the canvas, and nothing compared
 * the canvas to the space it has to fit in. That check now exists, and the
 * drawing was tightened rather than scaled -- see the width table below.
 *
 * THE HEIGHTS USED TO BE ONE NUMBER FOR ALL TWELVE CARDS, and that number was
 * 140 while the columns were stacked on a 160px pitch. Both were wrong in the
 * same direction, and a card is as tall as the copy inside it: the ordinary
 * dependency cards come out at 157, the app's at 165, Lakebase's at 197 and the
 * Vector Search index card's at 229. Two things followed, and the checks in this
 * file could see neither, because every one of them reasoned about a card shorter
 * than any that is drawn:
 *
 *   - THE MIDDLE COLUMN RAN ON THREE PIXELS. 160 of pitch against 157 of card,
 *     three times over, where a caption needs twenty-four -- and `conversation`
 *     and `trace` are placed in gaps like those. Three pixels is not a layout, it
 *     is the distance to one. Any sentence added to a role paragraph, or a status
 *     word four characters longer, spent it and put a card over the title of the
 *     card beneath: the cards are opaque, and each is painted after the one above
 *     it in the middle column, so the one that loses is always the lower.
 *   - THE BOTTOM OF THE RIGHT COLUMN WAS CUT OFF. The Vector Search endpoint's
 *     card is 173 tall at top 620, which is 793 on a canvas that was 760 -- and
 *     `.arch-canvas-scroll` is `overflow-y: hidden`, so those 33px were not
 *     scrolled to, they were gone, and the "Open in Databricks" link in them with
 *     it. THE CANVAS HEIGHT IS A CLIP, not a bound the drawing is checked against
 *     for tidiness, which is why every card is now asserted to be inside it.
 *
 * Fitting the canvas to the panel -- the other half of what was reported, fixed
 * first -- scaled all of that down along with everything else.
 *
 * So the heights are now DERIVED, per card, from the box model in
 * architecture.css and the copy in architecture.ts -- see {@link nodeHeight} --
 * and the tops below are spaced to clear them by {@link ROW_GAP_MIN}. Nothing is
 * measured in the DOM and nothing needs to be: the one part that cannot be
 * computed is how wide a glyph sets, and that is an explicit upper bound which
 * errs towards a taller card. Growing downwards is free, because the page scrolls
 * vertically and only the sideways scroll was ever the complaint.
 *
 * THE LINES WERE THE HALF NOBODY HAD A RULE FOR, and "the paths are very mixed
 * and hard to follow, weirdly curved" is what that reads as. Every edge was a
 * literal path string, so each one was drawn by hand against the card positions
 * of the day it was written, and three habits followed from that:
 *
 *   - CUBICS WHOSE CONTROL POINTS WENT BACKWARDS. `C716 315 700 86` puts the
 *     first handle to the RIGHT of the second, so the curve leaves the card,
 *     turns back on itself and kinks. Four of the fourteen edges did this, each
 *     by a different amount, which is why no two of them looked related.
 *   - AN EDGE THAT SKIPPED A COLUMN AND WENT THROUGH IT. The finder's line to
 *     the warehouse ran across the whole middle column at one y, threading a gap
 *     between two cards that happened to be there, and crossed three other edges
 *     on the way in.
 *   - ENDS THAT HAD TO BE RE-TYPED WHENEVER A CARD MOVED, which the old comment
 *     on the geometry table says out loud.
 *
 * So the edges are DERIVED too. Each one names the card edge it leaves, the card
 * edge it arrives at, and which of four shapes it is -- see {@link Route} and
 * {@link edgePath} -- and the path string is computed from the placement table
 * above it. A card that moves takes its lines with it, every diagonal is the
 * same monotone cubic, and the one edge that has to cross a column crosses it in
 * a stated channel rather than wherever its handles happened to fall.

 *
 * WIDTH: 1264, which is 30px inside {@link CANVAS_MAX_WIDTH}. It was 1400, from
 * the design, and 1400 has never fitted -- see the note at the top of this file.
 * The 136px came out of gaps, margins and four of the five column widths rather
 * than out of a `transform: scale()`, because a scaled canvas draws 13px type at
 * 11.7px, softens every glyph on the page's densest surface, and puts each card's
 * click target a few pixels from where it is painted.
 *
 * THE SAME TRADE WAS MADE A SECOND TIME, and it is the whole of the answer to
 * "the bubbles are crowding each other". Every column got NARROWER again and
 * every gap got WIDER, at a canvas that did not grow by a pixel:
 *
 *     margin  8 ->  12    browser 152 -> 140    gap 52 ->  74
 *     app   196 -> 184    gap      46 ->  62    agent 220 -> 208

 *     right 226 -> 210    margin    8 ->  12
 *
 * 70px came off the five cards and went into the four corridors, because a
 * corridor is where the captions are and a card that loses width only gets
 * taller. THE CARDS PAID FOR THE AIR IN THE ONE CURRENCY THIS DRAWING HAS
 * SPARE. Narrowing the middle column used to be refused here on the grounds
 * that a line added to a role paragraph was an overlap; that stopped being true
 * when the tops were spaced off the real heights, and this is the change that
 * spends what that bought. The four middle cards are 173, 157, 157 and 245 at
 * 232 wide, against 157, 157, 157 and 229 at 250, and every pixel of that went
 * downwards where the page already scrolls.
 *
 * EVERY GAP IS SIZED BY THE LONGEST WORD STANDING IN IT plus
 * {@link LABEL_CLEAR_MIN} at each end, which is the rule the old table was
 * missing rather than a number picked to look right. The first gap held
 * "question" -- 8 characters of 10px mono, 49.6px -- in 52, so the caption had
 * about a pixel of white on each side of it and read as touching both cards.
 * That passed every check in this file, because not-overlapping was all any of
 * them asked.
 *
 * THE 30px IS NOT SPARE AND SHOULD NOT BE SPENT. A desktop scrollbar takes its
 * width out of the layout viewport, so a 1440px window lays the shell out in
 * about 1425 and the panel offers about 1279 rather than the 1294 above. The
 * ceiling is the no-scrollbar case; the slack is what makes the real one fit.
 *
 * THE FOUR CORRIDORS ARE NOW ONE NUMBER, {@link COLUMN_GAP}, and the widths were
 * left alone to pay for it. They were 86, 74, 80 and 88, which is four
 * separations a reader compares across one drawing and finds four answers to; a
 * column pitch that changes as the eye travels right is read as the columns
 * meaning different amounts of distance. Nothing had to shrink for this: the five
 * card widths already summed to 912 and the four gaps to 328, and 328 divides by
 * four exactly. So every card keeps the width its copy was measured against --
 * and therefore its height, which is derived from that width -- and only the
 * lefts moved.
 *
 * HEIGHT: derived from the placement table, and it has to be recomputed by hand
 * whenever a top moves, which is what architecture-layout.test.ts asserts rather
 * than trusts: the lowest card's bottom plus the margin the highest card starts
 * at. The tallest column is no longer the one that decides it -- Lakebase hangs
 * lowest, on the storage row -- so the figure is a fact about the whole table
 * rather than about one stack.
 *
 * It was 760, then 832, then 939, and is 861 now that the re-space has taken the
 * slack out of the columns. 760 was not a margin short, it was a CLIP:
 * the scroller around this canvas is `overflow-y: hidden` and the canvas is given
 * this height in pixels, so the 33px by which the right-hand column overran it
 * were not reachable by scrolling. Height is the cheap dimension here -- the page
 * itself scrolls, and sideways scroll was the whole of the complaint -- which is
 * why the answer to a card that needs more room is always to give it more room.

 *
 * So the canvas is fitted to the panel instead, down to this floor. The floor was
 * 0.72, chosen for how small it draws the type: 13px at about 9px, "the point at

 * The placement, left to right in the order a question travels.
 *
 * The reader, then the app, then the orchestrator, then everything the
 * orchestrator talks to, then the compute and the governed source behind Genie.
 *
 * STORAGE IS THE BOTTOM ROW, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy. Lakebase
 * and the MLflow experiment sit below the two things that WRITE them, off to the
 * side of the left-to-right path, because neither is ever read to produce an
 * answer. Drawing either in line would say it was.
 *
 * The two semantic cards are the exception to that row, and they always were:
 * the index is drawn low on the far right and is on the answer path, and the
 * endpoint that hosts it sits in the column to its right, beneath the warehouse
 * and the catalog. That column is what-runs-it -- Genie's SQL runs on the
 * warehouse, a search runs on the endpoint -- so the pairing is the one the rest
 * of the drawing already uses.
 *
 * THE TOPS ARE SPACED OFF THE HEIGHTS rather than off a pitch, which is the fix
 * for the overlap. Every one of them is still a literal, because where a card
 * sits is a decision the design made. What is no longer a decision is how much
 * room a card needs; architecture-layout.test.ts checks each column against
 * {@link nodeHeight} plus {@link ROW_GAP_MIN} rather than trusting the
 * arithmetic that produced these:
 *
 *     x=222    app 190 + 105 = 295      ->  lakebase 644     (349, the drop to
 *                                                             the storage row)
 *     x=476    agent 160 + 148 = 308    ->  finder 352       (44)
 *              finder 352 + 105 = 457   ->  experiment 644   (187, same drop)
 *     x=754    llm 36 + 126 = 162       ->  dictionary 206   (44)
 *              dictionary 206 + 126 = 332 -> data 396        (64, the channel)
 *              data 396 + 126 = 522     ->  index 566        (44)
 *     x=1054   warehouse 260 + 148 = 408 -> catalog 452      (44)
 *              catalog 452 + 148 = 600  ->  endpoint 644     (44)
 *
 * The columns do not overlap sideways, so those seven pairs are the whole of the
 * collision question for the cards.
 *
 * 44 IS THE RHYTHM AND THE TWO EXCEPTIONS BOTH SAY SOMETHING. The 64 between the
 * two Genie cards is the corridor the finder's line to the warehouse runs along:
 * that edge has to cross this column, so it crosses it in a gap widened to leave
 * 32px of white above and below the line rather than threading whatever the
 * minimum happened to leave. The 349 and the 187 are the drop to the storage row,
 * which is the one place in this drawing where distance carries meaning -- see
 * below.
 *
 * THE STORAGE ROW IS A ROW AGAIN. Lakebase, the experiment and the Vector Search
 * endpoint share one top, 644, so the bottom of the canvas reads as a single band
 * rather than as three cards that each drifted low by a different amount. 644 is
 * not chosen: it is where the right-hand column's own 44px rhythm puts the
 * endpoint, and the two stores are brought to it. Their tops have to be below
 * every card on the answer path for architecture-layout.test.ts to accept them as
 * the bottom row, and the lowest of those is the catalog at 452, so the band could
 * not have been raised much further anyway.
 *
 * THE LEFT SPINE IS FLAT. Browser, app and orchestrator are placed so that one y
 * -- 242 -- lies inside all three, which is what lets the first two edges be
 * straight horizontal lines instead of curves that correct for a 20px difference
 * nobody chose. The tops differ because the heights do.

 *
 *   - `straight`  the two ends share an axis, so the line is one `H` or one `V`.
 *                 The plainest connector there is, and the first two edges of the
 *                 question path are now both of them.
 *   - `curve`     one cubic, with BOTH handles on the vertical line half way
 *                 between the two ends. That is the only cubic in this file, and
 *                 the constraint is what makes it readable: x moves one way for
 *                 the whole curve, the tangent is horizontal at both ends, and
 *                 two of them side by side are the same shape at different
 *                 scales. The old handles were at 716 and 700 -- the first to the
 *                 RIGHT of the second -- which is a curve that leaves the card,
 *                 turns back on itself, and kinks in the middle.
 *   - `channel`   for the one edge that skips a column. A `curve`'s worth of bend
 *                 in the corridor, onto the y it will arrive at, then a straight
 *                 run across the column it has to cross. A skip edge cannot avoid

 *                 through a gap widened for it rather than as a diagonal through
 *                 whatever room was left.
 *   - `bracket`   for the one edge that has to get past a card in its own column.
 *                 Out sideways into the corridor, down it, and back in at the
 *                 same x it left -- square, with rounded corners. The old path
 *                 did this as a single cubic bulging 120px left, which reads as a
 *                 line that has come loose rather than as a line going round
