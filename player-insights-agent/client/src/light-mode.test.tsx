/**
 * LIGHT MODE IS DAYLIGHT ALL THE WAY THROUGH.
 *
 * The reported fault, in the reader's words: the night sky was still there in
 * light mode -- behind the answer cards, and down the whole of the Active steps
 * column -- and the answer card itself read as a grey pane on it. Three separate
 * causes, one appearance:
 *
 *   1. `.app-sky`, the app-wide starfield, was hidden outside dark by an
 *      unconditional default in the DARK theme's own stylesheet, which is a ban
 *      expressed as the absence of an opt-in.
 *   2. `.ask-layout` and `.trace-inspector` paint `--ast-sky-fill` and the
 *      starfield UNCONDITIONALLY. `--ast-sky-fill` is navy at `:root` (dark
 *      reads it) and remaps to Ice outside dark, so a leftover use cannot
 *      keep a charcoal page.
 *   3. `--ast-pane`, which is what the answer card, the question bubble and the
 *      composer are all drawn on, is 94% white -- so whatever was behind them
 *      showed through, and in light mode what was behind them was (2).
 *
 * And one thing that is not a bug and had to be replaced rather than hidden: the
 * live agent band IS a night sky, by design (`#18a`), so there is no daylight
 * version of it. `StepRail` is the same run as a list of rows on white, and the
 * theme picks between the two in CSS.
 *
 * WHY THESE ARE TESTS. Every claim below is invisible on the surface it governs.
 * A theme that has quietly gone back to painting stars behind an opaque card looks
 * completely correct until the card's alpha changes; a second copy of the step list
 * in the accessibility tree is silent to everybody who can see the screen; and the
 * whole arrangement is decided by CSS selectors, which no rendering test in this
 * suite can observe. So the checks are split the way the implementation is: the
 * stylesheet claims are read back out of the stylesheet, and the markup claims are
 * rendered.
 *
 * THE CONDITION IS ALWAYS `:not([data-theme='dark'])`. Every light rule in the app
 * is written that way rather than as `[data-theme='light']`, so the two halves of
 * each pair are exhaustive: there is no attribute value, including none at all,
 * that leaves a surface with neither treatment. `dark` gets the sky and everything
 * else gets daylight.
