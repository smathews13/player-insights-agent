/**
 * The Benchmark Lab switch in the state it was reported in: pressed.
 *
 * REPORTED TWICE AS "STILL NOT FIXED" AFTER THREE FIXES, and benchmark-toggle.test.ts
 * says plainly why it could be: it reads settings.css as text and reasons about
 * the arithmetic in it, and it says so in its own header -- "nothing below
 * presses the switch". That leaves one join unchecked, and it is the join every
 * one of those rules depends on. The switch is a library control. Its geometry
 * is written here as three selectors keyed on `data-slot`, `data-state` and an
 * ancestor class, none of which this repository owns. If AppKit renames a slot,
 * or Radix stops writing `data-state` on the root, or the page wrapper loses
 * `settings-page`, then all of that arithmetic is correct and applies to
 * nothing: the knob reverts to the library's own 16px inside a 14px box and the
 * control looks exactly as reported, while every assertion about the stylesheet
 * stays green. That is the shape of a fault that survives three fixes.
 *
 * So this file renders the real control from the real page, in both states, and
 * asks whether the rules match what came out. It still runs in node with no
 * browser: what it cannot do is say the result is handsome. What it can do, and
 * what the file beside it cannot, is fail when the stylesheet stops being about
 * the control.
