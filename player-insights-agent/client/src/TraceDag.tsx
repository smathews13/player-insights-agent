/**
 * The run's stages as a chain of nodes, drawn in two arrangements.
 *
 * Split out of App.tsx when the pages became modules. Ask PIA draws it in the
 * narrow right-hand rail and Run Explorer draws it full width on the Agent map
 * tab, which is the whole reason there is a prop.
 *
 * `compact` chooses the arrangement, and the component does not guess: the
 * container declares which one it is and the class it writes, `compact` or `map`,
 * is what every rule in trace.css hangs off. Both classes are always present on
 * one of the two branches, so no geometry is a bare default that the other
 * variant silently inherits. That is not a style preference, it is the bug that
 * put this file in front of a customer: the map's wrapping was written as the
 * default on `.dag-step`, a 190px flex basis, and in the rail's column that basis
 * is a HEIGHT. Every step in the rail became a 190px box holding a 60px card, so
 * the pane drew four cards separated by a card's worth of nothing with the
 * connector labels stranded in the middle of it.
 *
 * THE TWO DRAW DIFFERENT CARDS, and that is worth stating plainly rather than
 * leaving to be discovered. The map's card is a two-line tile -- a kind chip, a
 * two-digit step number and a right-pinned duration above a clamped name -- in
 * rows of four. The rail's is one line in a 264px column: a numbered badge, a
 * 13px mark, the name, and the duration pinned right. One markup bent into both
 * shapes by CSS is how the 190px basis came to be written at all.
 *
 * What is shared is the only thing that ever mattered: the READINGS. Both take
 * their duration from `formatMs`, their step number from `stepNumber`, their tool
 * name from `toolNameFromId` and their order from the stage list, so neither can
 * describe a measurement differently from the other or from the Timeline tab, and
 * a step is the same number in both.
 *
 * The rail is now specified as well, in
 * docs/design-handoff-pia-dubois-revamp/live-agent-path.md, which is where its
 * numbering, its indent and its three connector shapes come from. It is the pane
 * shown while a run is in flight, so it is the only one with a live state: the
 * card at `activeIndex` is the step in progress, and `elapsedMs` is how long it
 * has been going. Both are decided by the caller, which is the only place that
 * knows whether the run is still going; a component that read the clock itself
 * is how a finished run gets left counting.
 *
 * BOTH OPEN, AND BY THE SAME PRESS. A node is a button, and pressing it reveals
 * what the stage actually recorded -- the tool's real name, when it started, what
 * it was handed and what came back. Neither card can hold that itself: the map's
 * is one of twelve in a grid and a card that grows to fit a SQL statement takes
 * its whole row with it, and the rail's is a one-line tile whose height the
 * connectors are drawn against. So the panel is a row of its own at the foot of
 * either arrangement, and the cards stay the fixed, alignable tiles they were.
 *
 * The rail was plain divs until the column was widened, and the argument for that
 * was arithmetic rather than principle: at 264px with a transcript beside it there
 * was nowhere to read a payload, and a step that looks pressable and is not is
 * worse than the record it already is. The column is 340px now and the premise is
 * gone with it. What has not changed is that there is ONE panel: the rail seats
 * the map's own, so a step reads the same either side of the app rather than being
 * described twice.
 *
 * Every string either card prints is decided in `agent-map.ts` rather than here,
 * because vitest runs on `node`: a rule that only exists inside markup can be
 * asserted against a rendered tree and never against itself.

/**
 * What kind of step this was, as a 22px chip.
 *
 * Two fills and no more, which is the design's own distinction: an agent decision
 * sits on Ice, the AI-context surface, and a tool call on the neutral wash. The
 * glyph says WHICH tool; the fill says whether the agent was thinking or calling
 * something.
 *
 * AN AGENT DECISION IS CHIPPED WITH THE MARK, because the mark IS the agent.
 * `astrolabe-rebuild-spec.md` §1 settles it and §9 lists the orange robot among
 * the things this design retires rather than restyles, so the robot's chip is not
 * restained here -- the figure inside it is a different figure. The Ice fill is
 * §2's replacement for the oat the robot used to sit on, and it is the same
 * surface every other agent-context object in this design gets.
 *
 * The rail marks its own agent steps with the same mark, out of the same file, at
 * 13px and with no chip behind it, which is what makes a step the same thing in
 * both panes.
 *
 * The chip is a report and not an affordance -- the whole card is the button --
 * so nothing here changes on hover or on focus.
 *
 * A TOOL CALL IS CHIPPED WITH ITS PRODUCT'S MARK, recoloured, at the handoff's
 * 14px, and which product that is comes out of the shared map rather than out of
 * one declared here. It used to be declared here, over three DuBois INTERFACE
 * glyphs -- a bookmarked document, the letters S/Q/L, a sparkle -- filed under
 * Unity Catalog, Databricks SQL and Genie. They are not those products' marks.
 * They are the icons that sit beside carets and padlocks, and a reader who knows
 * the Databricks marks read one as a product mark and was then wrong about which
 * product ran.
 *
 * Recoloured rather than full-colour: §9 retires the full-colour marks from the
 * UI, and `brand-icons.ts` holds both cuts in one module, so no surface can file
 * a tool under a second product. The wrench still stands for a tool nobody has
 * classified, which is the case that has no honest mark.
 *
 * The chip names its product in a tooltip, because this is the one seating in
 * the app where no text label sits beside the mark: the card's line below names
 * the TOOL, not the product behind it, and four logos at 14px are not four
 * things every reader can tell apart.

/**
 * What one stage recorded, opened from its node on the map.
 *
 * Every line is read off the stage and nothing is filled in. The header carries
 * the offset, the elapsed and the call count on one right-pinned line, which is
 * the design's arrangement and also removes the two labelled rows a reader had to
 * scan a grid for. A start that was never measured says so in words rather than
 * printing a zero, for the reason `startMeasured` exists at all: a missing origin
 * and an origin of zero arrive as the same number, and the first stage of every
 * run legitimately starts at zero.
 *
 * Token counts appear only when MLflow recorded a direct LLM invocation that can
 * be correlated to this stage. Tool-only stages remain unmetered rather than
 * gaining a zero or a share of the run total.
 *
 * A STAGE THAT FAILED OPENS ON RAW. The design asks for the server quoted
 * verbatim, and `Rendered` is a reading of the text: paragraphs, or a table if
 * the lines happen to form a grid. An error message is neither, and putting one
 * through a renderer is exactly where a stack trace loses the line breaks that
 * make it legible. `Reference` is the stage's own id, which is the only handle
 * the record carries for finding this step again; the design asks for a
 * correlation id and the agent does not write one.
 *
 * Exported for the test that renders it on its own. The suite runs without a
 * DOM, so there is no button to press and no other way to see what a node
 * reveals; the alternative was asserting against this file's source text, which
 * would pin the code rather than what a reader is told.

   * twice in a column 264px wide. They are how a reader opens a step now, so
   * off-screen would leave every step of a live run reachable by keyboard and
   * invisible to whoever pressed it -- the fault that box was written to avoid,
