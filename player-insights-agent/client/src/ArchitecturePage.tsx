/**
 * What this deployment is made of, drawn from what it actually reports.
 *
 * THE DIAGRAM IS A SECOND VIEW OF THE CONNECTIONS MODEL, not a picture of it.
 * Every node that names a dependency is a `ConnectedResource`, and its pills, its
 * identifier and its drift come from `connection-model.ts`, the derivation the
 * Connections page renders. The two cannot describe different deployments,
 * because there is only one reading. A diagram is believed in a way a list is
 * not, so a diagram that had its own opinion about what the app is wired to
 * would be the most expensive kind of wrong.
 *
 * THE CHECKS RUN THEMSELVES, ONCE PER SESSION, and this page does not decide
 * when. `/api/architecture` is still the cheap read this page makes for itself:
 * it returns what the app container was given and costs no round trip. The two
 * payloads that carry reachability are expensive, so they run once for the whole
 * session through `session-checks.ts` -- on whichever of this page and
 * Connections is opened first -- and the Refresh control is the only thing that
 * re-runs them after that.
 *
 * It used to be that nothing ran until Refresh was pressed, and the info row at
 * the bottom said so. The cost reasoning was right and the conclusion was wrong:
 * a page that opens without operational verdicts reads as broken, not as
 * pending, and it was read that way by the person it was built for.
 *
 * COLOUR HERE STATES WHAT A CONNECTION IS, NEVER HOW IT IS. The accent on a
 * card's edge, the colour of a line and the colour of the dot travelling along it
 * say question path, agent, Genie space, semantic search, governed data or
 * storage. Status lives in the pills and nowhere else. Two vocabularies in one
 * drawing would make a healthy teal node read as a warning.
 *
 * No figure appears here that was not read from something. There is no latency on
 * this page and no row count, because nothing in this app measures them per
 * dependency; where the reference this was modelled on prints a number, this
 * prints what it is waiting for.
