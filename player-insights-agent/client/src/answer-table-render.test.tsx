/**
 * What the agent's table LOOKS LIKE once the answer card draws it.
 *
 * The companion to the table cases in answer-markdown.test.ts, which assert the
 * parse. This file asserts the drawing, and it exists because the parse was
 * never the thing anybody complained about: what was reported was a screenful of
 * pipes and dashes in the answer body, and every assertion anyone would have
 * thought to write about the answer's TEXT was true while that was on screen.
 * Nothing short of rendering the block and reading the markup back could fail.
 *
 * So the claim each test makes is a claim about the element that appeared -- a
 * table where there was a paragraph, cells where there were pipes -- and not
 * about the class names it is made of.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT VERIFIED HERE, and cannot be without a browser: how any of it
 * looks, where the columns actually land, and whether the wrapper scrolls at the
 * width a reader has. The stylesheet block at the end is the same trade the rest
 * of this repo's style tests make: it proves the rules exist and say what they
 * need to say, not that the result has been seen.
 *
 * Rendered through `renderToStaticMarkup`, so no effect runs and the tracked
 * table list is empty -- the state every answer passes through first. What the
 * table says must not depend on whether a cell turned out to be a link.
