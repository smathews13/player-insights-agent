/**
 * That the header actually draws a role badge, and what it says in each of the
 * four states.
 *
 * THE FIRST TEST IN THIS FILE IS THE POINT OF THE FILE. role.ts computed all
 * four states, both tooltips, the accessible names, the live-region wording and
 * the badge-then-name-then-gear order, and had thorough tests for every one of
 * them, all passing. Nothing in the app called any of it. The component those
 * tests describe -- RoleBadge.tsx, named in role.ts's own comments -- had never
 * been written, so the header simply had no badge, and it shipped that way. Not
 * one existing test failed, because every one of them tested the module.
 *
 * That is the same failure nav-role.test.tsx was written for, a tab row that
 * role.ts specified and Layout.tsx did not draw, and the lesson took twice. So
 * the assertion below renders the HEADER and fails when there is no badge in it.
 * A test of `badgeLabel` cannot fail for a missing caller; only this can.
 *
 * PIXELS ARE NOT VERIFIED BY ANY OF THIS. It is markup, wording and the rules in
 * shell.css. Nothing here says the chip fits beside the name.
