/**
 * What the Benchmark Lab actually puts on screen, rendered rather than read.
 *
 * This screen reports scores, which makes it the one place in the app where a
 * test that passes while the page is wrong is worst: a reader takes a number off
 * it and repeats the number to somebody else. It has been wrong twice in ways no
 * source-text assertion could have caught, both times because the statement being
 * checked was true of a component that nothing rendered, or true of a derivation
 * whose output the screen then ignored.
 *
 * So every assertion below goes through the real derivation into the real markup.
 * The page's own run arrives through an effect, which a static render never runs,
 * so the panels are rendered directly with a run — the same shape `RunDetails`
 * next door is tested in. What that cannot cover is anything about the fetch, the
 * poll, or hover and focus: those are named in the report rather than asserted.
 */

/**
 * A run of the shape the design's own mockup describes: judged by a named model,
 * executed as a person, cut short before it attempted every case, and pinned to a
 * served model version. Rare in practice, and the case that matters, because every
 * qualification row and every denominator is exercised at once.
 *
 * The numbers are internally consistent on purpose. Twelve cases in the suite of
 * twenty were reached; groundedness reached a verdict on eleven of them, with one
 * case the rubric did not apply to; guidelines applies to fewer still.
