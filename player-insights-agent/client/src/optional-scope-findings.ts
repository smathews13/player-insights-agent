/**
 * A shortfall in a permission this app calls optional is not something to fix.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CORRECTS. The Connections panel is headed "What to fix" and drew one
 * block per refused check. On the example deployment that meant four blocks: the
 * catalog, the schema, the twelve tables collected into one, and the Vector
 * Search index. All of those turn on scopes `shared/optional-user-api-scopes.ts`
 * records as OPTIONAL -- `catalog.catalogs:read`, `catalog.schemas:read`,
 * `catalog.tables:read`, `workspace.workspace:read`, and (Sam's 2026-08-18 call)
 * the two `vectorsearch.*:read` browse reads: no ask needs the APP's forwarded
 * token to carry them, a deployment may leave them off its OAuth config
 * entirely, and the login gate and the Identity card already draw them neutrally
 * for exactly that reason. The Connections page was the one surface left telling
 * a reader to go and fix permissions the app had already decided it can live
 * without.
 *
 * WHY IT READS A VALUE AND NOT THE PROSE. Each of those blocks says which
 * permission it turned on, in a sentence, and matching the sentence would be the
 * third copy of a scope vocabulary that has misfired twice in this repository.
 * The probe that took the refusal records the name on the check
 * (`PreflightCheck.scope`), so this is a set membership test on a value rather
 * than a guess about English.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT MOVED OUT OF THE PANEL:
 *
 *   - anything `failed`. A failure was established ABOUT THE OBJECT, and no
 *     optional permission explains it away. Only the `refused` verdict is
 *     eligible, which is also the only one whose meaning is "the call stopped
 *     before it reached the object" (DECISIONS.md D6 and D8).
 *   - a refusal over a REQUIRED permission, whatever else is on the page. The
 *     ask-path scopes (`sql`, `dashboards.genie`, serving) are required and stay
 *     in the panel as findings. The Vector Search reads used to be here too;
 *     Sam's 2026-08-18 call moved them to OPTIONAL alongside catalog, because
 *     they browse VS from the APP's forwarded token and ask-time semantic
 *     retrieval runs on the MODEL's own token instead. A VS browse refusal is
 *     now a neutral shortfall, not a finding.
 *   - a refusal that named no permission. An absent `scope` means nothing
 *     established which permission was implicated, and reading that silence as
 *     "an optional one, probably" is how a real finding gets hidden.
 *
 * Pure and separate from the page, so what the panel is allowed to draw is
 * assertable without composing markup.
