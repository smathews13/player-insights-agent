  /**
   * The rail, in one round trip rather than two.
   *
   * ONE EFFECT FOR BOTH LISTS, and the reason is stated in initial-rail.ts: as
   * two effects the requests did overlap, but only because effects happen to run
   * back-to-back, and that is one `await` away from becoming a waterfall. Asking
   * for them together makes the concurrency something the code says rather than
   * something the scheduler happens to do -- and gives the suite something it can
   * count, which two fetches inside effects were not.
   *
   * BOTH ISSUED TOGETHER, EACH AWAITED ON ITS OWN, and the second half is not
   * tidiness. `conversationLoading` below is not a spinner on the rail: while it
   * is true this page hides the welcome screen and disables the composer, so
   * whatever clears it decides when the reader may start typing. Waiting on one
   * combined promise made that the slower of the two reads -- and the run list is
   * the heavier one while feeding nothing but the status pills, so a decoration on
   * the rail was holding the text box shut.
   *
   * The two failures are handled differently and that is not an oversight: a
   * rail without pills is still a rail, and a rail without conversations is an
   * outage the reader is told about. See `InitialRail`.

 * One row of the transcript: a question the reader asked, or whatever the agent

 *
 * MEMOIZED, AND THE CLOCK IS THE REASON. While a run is in flight the page ticks
 * `now` once a second so the elapsed counters move. Every one of those ticks used
 * to re-render the whole transcript with it -- every answer card, its plan card,
 * its sources, its timeline and its charts -- to change a number that is not in
 * any of them. On a long thread on a mid-range machine that is the most
 * expensive thing this page does while doing nothing.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THE MEMO ACTUALLY WORK is that none of these props is rebuilt per
 * render. `message` and `response` come from state and a `useMemo`; `asker` is
 * the stable address string; `feedback` is either the entry from state or one
 * shared empty object; and the three callbacks are stable for the life of the page
 * -- see `askRow` and its neighbours, which exist for that reason alone. A single
 * inline arrow function in the list above would defeat every line of this.
 *
 * The JSX below is the transcript's, moved rather than rewritten: it is the same
 * markup, the same order of cases, and the same comments, so what a reader sees
 * is unchanged.
