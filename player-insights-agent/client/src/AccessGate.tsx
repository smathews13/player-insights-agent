   * There is deliberately no status strip here. One stood above every page for
   * the whole session and was narrowed three times trying to make it tolerable:
   * a paragraph became a line, the line lost the execution claim it had no right
   * to make, then user-verified auto-hid, then the rest became dismissible. None
   * of that answered the objection, because the objection was to a governance
   * status row being the first thing read on every screen of a customer demo.
   *
   * Nothing is lost by removing it. The mode, the principal, and the server's
   * own account of what was verified are on the Connections page, which is
   * somewhere a reader goes and asks rather than somewhere they are told. Please
   * do not reinstate the strip: put it on Connections, where the record already
   * is, or in the header where it can be one control among several.
