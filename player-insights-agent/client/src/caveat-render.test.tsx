/**

 * It was reported as never appearing on real answers, and the four places it
 * could have been lost -- the agent not sending it, the ask route dropping it,
 * `normalizeAnswer` reading it off the wrong key or nesting level, and the
 * render condition being unsatisfiable -- all looked correct on inspection. So
 * did the deployed bundle. The panel does render, and the evidence for that is
 * this file: the payload below has the same shape as the ones a live workspace
 * returns, `caveats` a flat array of strings at the top level beside `figures`
 * and `sources`, and it goes through the real normaliser into the real card.
 *
 * Written as a render rather than as assertions about the source, which is what
 * `caveat-list.test.ts` next to it does. That file pins how the block is
 * written -- one bullet each, unsorted, uncapped, verbatim -- and it passed
 * throughout, because every one of those statements can be true of a block that
 * nothing ever reaches. A key renamed anywhere between the wire and the bullet
 * would leave it passing and this failing, which is the whole reason to render.
