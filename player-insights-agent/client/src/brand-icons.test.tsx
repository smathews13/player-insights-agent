/**
 * The product marks: the right drawing for the right product, unaltered, and in
 * one place.
 *
 * Three defects sit behind this file, and each has an assertion here.
 *
 * The first is the one a reader would notice. The agent map chipped Unity
 * Catalog, Databricks SQL and Genie with DuBois INTERFACE glyphs -- a bookmarked
 * document, the letters S/Q/L, a sparkle -- filed under those product names in a
 * map inside `TraceDag.tsx`. They are not the product marks and they never were;
 * they are the icons that sit beside carets and padlocks, drawn in #5F7281 and
 * #6F6F6F. Somebody who knows the Databricks marks reads a lookalike as one and
 * is then wrong about which product ran, which is worse than an honest app
 * glyph, and it is the one failure a screenshot review does not catch because the
 * chips look deliberate.
 *
 * The second is why the mapping now lives in a module of its own. It used to be
 * declared at the top of a 600-line component, so the only person who could see
 * it was the one editing that component, and the three other screens the handoff
 * puts the same per-tool marks on had no way to agree with it. Two marks for one
 * product are never on screen together for anyone to compare.
 *
 * The third is what the artwork assertions are for. "Never redrawn" cannot be
 * held by a `<path>` typed into JSX: it starts identical and is then indented,
 * minified or tidied by somebody with nothing to compare it against. So the
 * component inlines the committed file, and these read the file off disk and find
 * it in the rendered markup. They fail on any edit to the artwork, which is the
 * point.
 *
 * What none of this can do is say the marks look right on screen. It can say
 * which file rendered, at what size, in which ink; it cannot say the 12px chip is
 * legible at 12px. That needs eyes.
