/**
 * Colour is rationed by meaning, and this is the only thing that checks it still is.
 *
 * The app used to be black on white with three accents. It is DuBois now, with five
 * meanings and five hues: blue for anything you press or that is currently active,
 * orange for the agent working, amber for evaluation, red for failure, green for
 * reachable. The hues changed; the discipline did not, and the discipline is the part
 * a stylesheet cannot state about itself.
 *
 * The failure this guards against is not a broken build. It is a plausible-looking
 * hover state, added months from now by someone who never read the token block, that
 * quietly makes one of the five ambient and takes the meaning of every genuine
 * instance with it. That is what happened to the brand red this palette replaced: it
 * was on the header rule, every eyebrow, the selected row, focus and the composer, and
 * red spent on the sixty-first thing on a screen signals nothing at all.
 *
 * Three rules do most of the work here, and they are the three a hand-restyle breaks
 * first:
 *
 *   - An accent may not be text. Orange is 3.62:1 on white and amber 1.90:1, so
 *     neither can be a label, and the deep rungs exist for when evaluation has to be
 *     type.
 *   - An accent may not be a lone hairline. Same arithmetic: a 1px edge nobody can
 *     see is not an edge, and it spends the colour where it cannot be read.
 *   - Evaluation may not appear on an action. Amber on a button says the button is
 *     being judged, which is the one thing it never means.
 *
 * The contrast figures the token block quotes are recomputed here rather than trusted.
 * A comment claiming 3.62:1 is worth nothing the day someone lightens the token to
 * make it pop and leaves the comment alone.
 *
 * The literal checks are about literals rather than about which selector uses which
 * token. Adding a red state on purpose is allowed -- .live-step.failed is one -- and
 * it should not need this file amended. Reaching past the tokens to write a colour by
 * hand is the move that has never once been correct here.
