/**
 * The card the app opens on, once a session: who you are signed in as, the
 * scopes this deployment asks for one row at a time, and the disclaimer.
 *
 * Built to `login-gate.md`. Three departures from it, each deliberate and each
 * noted where it happens:
 *
 *   1. REQUIRED SHORTFALLS HAVE A REPAIR, NOT A SKIP. The signed-in user's
 *      forwarded token updates this App resource without replacing any scopes
 *      already granted. Optional or unread checks may still be skipped.
 *   2. THE TWO CORPORATE MARKS ARE HERE NOW, and this note used to say they
 *      could not be. `assets/brand/` held seven PRODUCT marks and no corporate
 *      mark, so the card carried its heading alone rather than substitute a
 *      product logo for one it is not. Both marks have since been committed --
 *      `databricks-logo-full-color.svg` above the lockup and
 *      `databricks-symbol-color.svg` in the disclaimer heading -- and §2 makes
 *      this card and the top bar's attribution the only two places in the
 *      product where full-colour Databricks artwork renders.
 *   3. THE MISSING-SCOPES FOOTER DOES NOT SEND THE READER TO THEIR ADMIN. The
 *      spec's wording is "N scopes are missing. Ask your workspace admin to add
 *      `x` to the app's OAuth configuration", and it cannot be right on this
 *      screen: the names in that list are the app's own declaration minus what
 *      the sign-in carries, so every one of them is already in the app's OAuth
 *      configuration and the admin has nothing to add. The reader's own browser
 *      is the fix. See `missingFooter` for the days that sentence cost.
 *      Singular is handled there too, because "1 scopes" is the likeliest case
 *      and the spec only wrote the plural.
 *
 * SKIP DISMISSES THE CARD AND CHANGES NOTHING ELSE. It remains available only
 * when no required shortfall can be repaired here, and records that the checks
 * were SKIPPED rather than passed.
 * It grants no scope, re-runs no comparison, sends no request, and selects no
 * fallback: after taking it the app still reads governed data as the signed-in
 * person, still gets refused whatever their grants refuse, and still surfaces
 * those refusals unchanged. In particular it CANNOT move execution onto the
 * app's own service principal. That is `POST /api/access-mode`, which belongs to
 * the separate and switched-off `AccessGate` (`shared/access-gate.ts`), is not
 * called from this file, and must not be: reading governed data as the app was
 * removed at the customer's explicit request, and a convenience on this screen
 * is not a reason to reintroduce it.
 *
 * Split in two on purpose. `FirstOpenPanel` is markup and nothing else, so the
 * three states can be rendered and asserted with `renderToStaticMarkup` in a test
 * run that has no DOM. `FirstOpenGate` holds the session latch and the identity.
