/**
 * Ops: whether this deployment is working, what it costs, and how much of it
 * people use.
 *
 * THREE BLOCKS THAT DO NOT DEPEND ON EACH OTHER, and that is the design rather
 * than an implementation detail. Health is a probe of live dependencies, cost is
 * a query against workspace billing tables, traffic is a query against the app's
 * own store. They are three different systems with three different failure
 * modes and three very different latencies, and the billing query is the slow
 * one. Behind a single route, a billing table an admin has no grant on would
 * hold up the block that says whether the warehouse is answering, at exactly the
 * moment somebody is trying to find out why nothing works.
 *
 * So each block fetches itself, fails by itself, and carries its own read time.
 * Three timestamps on one page look untidy and are honest: they were read at
 * three different moments and one of them can be twenty minutes older than the
 * others.
 *
 * THE SHAPE IS THE HANDOFF'S. Each block is a bordered card with a #F7F7F7
 * header band carrying its title, the one line that qualifies everything under
 * it, and its own read control; the body sits inside the border and a hairline
 * footer holds whatever the body cannot say about itself. Health is a table,
 * cost is a grid of tiles, traffic is three charts in three columns. See
 * `docs/design-handoff-pia-dubois-revamp/ops-tab.md`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DECIDE. Every claim about a number is in
 * `ops-view.ts`, so it can be asserted without rendering anything. This file is
 * layout and ARIA. It also does not own:
 *
 *  - The Refresh control and its freshness line, which are `RefreshControl`.
 *  - The failure and refusal taxonomy, which is the server's.
 *
 * NO POLLING, for the reason Monitoring does not poll: the billing query scans
 * a workspace-wide table, and a page that re-ran it every thirty seconds would
 * cost money to look at. The same reason the four blocks are kept in
 * `ops-session.ts` rather than in this page's `useState`: leaving the tab and
 * coming back is not a reason to scan billing again. Refresh still is.
