/**
 * The shape of this deployment, as a graph whose nodes are real connections.
 *
 * EVERY NODE THAT NAMES A DEPENDENCY NAMES A `ConnectedResource`. Its status,
 * its identifier and its drift come from `connection-model.ts`, which is the
 * derivation the Connections page renders, so the diagram and the list cannot
 * describe different deployments. A node here that had its own idea of whether
 * the warehouse was reachable would eventually be confidently wrong, and a
 * confident diagram is believed in a way a list is not.
 *
 * Two nodes name no resource, and say so rather than borrowing a status that
 * means something else: `browser` and `app` are where the code runs. There is no
 * remote end to probe -- the reader is looking at the browser, and the app
 * answered the request that drew the page.
 *
 * `semantic-index` used to be a third, and the reason it no longer is was a bug
 * rather than a design. The orchestrator reports whether it searches an index; it
 * simply reported it under a key nothing on this side read, so the node had to say
 * the app could not see. It is a registry entry like any other now, and the one
 * case still worth a sentence of its own is a served version older than that
 * report, where absence genuinely means unknown -- see
 * {@link SEMANTIC_INDEX_UNREPORTED}.
 *
 * THE SEMANTIC LANE IS TWO OBJECTS, and drawing it as one hid a real fault. The
 * index is a Unity Catalog object; the endpoint is the compute that hosts it,
 * created by the bundle rather than named in the artifact. They fail separately
 * and cost separately -- an endpoint runs and bills by the hour whether or not
 * anything searches the index on it, and an index can be present and refused on
 * an endpoint that is perfectly healthy. With one card on the drawing those two
 * failures looked identical. The app has probed both since the workspace probes
 * were added; only the diagram was short a card, and only because nothing named
 * the endpoint as a connection for it to draw.
 *
 * The edges carry sentences rather than arrowheads. The meaning of an edge is
 * the thing a diagram usually leaves to a reader who can see it, so it is
 * written down here once and used both for the visible caption and for the
 * text equivalent a screen reader gets.

/**
 * The one sentence left on the page, as the person who owns the words wrote it.
 *
 * Held here rather than in the page because it makes a claim about something
 * outside itself -- when the checks run, which is a fact about what the page
 * fetches -- and architecture-render.test.tsx asserts the string and the claim
 * together, so a change to when the checks run fails beside the sentence it
 * contradicts.
 *
 * Earlier approved copy said checks only ran after Refresh. That stopped being
 * true when the checks began running themselves, so the stale explanation was
 * removed rather than teaching readers to distrust the statuses.
 *
 * The page's own sub-headline and the line under Live data flow were deleted
 * rather than rewritten. Neither was wrong; both explained the tab to a reader
 * who had just clicked it, and the layout claim ("storage sits on the bottom
 * row") is one the diagram makes better than a sentence about the diagram can.
