/**
 * A recorded step result, drawn as the shape it is.
 *
 * The Rendered view in Run Explorer used to be one reading for everything:
 * paragraphs, or a table when every line happened to be a consistent grid. So a
 * Genie result -- which carries the space that answered, how it read the
 * question, the rows, and a sentence about them -- arrived as a single paragraph
 * beginning "Asking Genie space Player Insights Data
 * (d00dfeedd00dfeedd00dfeedd00dfeed). Query
 * interpretation: You want to see…", and a semantic search arrived as a
 * five-thousand-character dash-run of column names.
 *
 * THE RENDERER IS CHOSEN BY THE TOOL, not sniffed out of the text. `data_genie`
 * and `dictionary_genie` write Genie's four parts, `search_semantics` writes
 * table blocks, an agent step writes Markdown; those are facts about the agent
 * rather than guesses about a string, and a heuristic would eventually promote a
 * result that merely looked like one of them.
 *
 * EVERY PATH DEGRADES, and that is the property to keep. Each parse in
 * `step-results.ts` returns null when it cannot find its shape, and every null
 * lands on rendered Markdown -- real bold, mono, lists -- which is still a
 * reading of the text rather than the text. Raw is one click away and byte-exact
 * either way, which is what makes attempting a reading safe at all.
 *
 * There is no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in this file and no node shape that could
 * carry one, for the reason `answer-markdown.ts` spells out: this is model
 * output, and the tree it parses into has no branch that holds markup.
