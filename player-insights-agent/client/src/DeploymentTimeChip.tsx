/**
 * The running app deployment's release date, small enough to sit in the lockup.
 *
 * The timestamp is the Apps API's active deployment `create_time`, shared with
 * the Build and telemetry card.
 *
 * ONLY THE DATE IS DRAWN. The chip used to print "Deployed Aug 20, 11:07" at the
 * far right of the header, where it was the last thing in a row that gives, so
 * on an ordinary window it truncated to "Deployed Aug 20, 11:07 ..." -- a label
 * whose most precise part was the part that got cut. Beside the wordmark, where
 * it now sits, the question it answers is "which build am I looking at", and the
 * date answers it in six characters. The time and the commit are on the tooltip
 * for the reader who is reconciling a deploy against a push.

/**
 * THE TOOLTIP IS AN ELEMENT, NOT A `title` ATTRIBUTE, and the difference is the
 * whole of why this chip spent a release claiming a tooltip nobody could read.
 *
 * A `title` is pointer-only. `<time>` takes no focus, so there was no keystroke
 * that could reach the release time at all, and a `title` on an element that has
 * its own text content is not the element's accessible description either -- the
 * name comes from the contents and the attribute is dropped. So the string was
 * in the markup, the suite asserted the string was in the markup, and the fact
 * was unreachable by hover on a 40px target, by keyboard, and by screen reader.
 *
 * What replaces it is a described-by element that is always rendered whenever
 * there is a stamp to describe. Its visibility is one CSS rule keyed to `:hover`
 * and `:focus-visible` on the chip, so there is no provider to wrap it in, no
 * portal to mount, and no state that can be wrong -- the three ways a tooltip
 * component fails open. It is `opacity`-hidden rather than `visibility`-hidden
 * because `aria-describedby` must still resolve while it is not on screen.
