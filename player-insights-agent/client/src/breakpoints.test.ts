/**
 * One set of widths, and the exception to it named rather than merely present.
 *
 * responsive.css opens by saying it centralises the app's breakpoints, and the
 * reason that claim is worth a test is the defect it was written to fix: there
 * used to be two sets, Tailwind's and this one, both live and neither chosen, so
 * the nav collapsed 100px after the column it shares a header with. A stray query
 * in a page partial is the same failure starting again, and it is invisible until
 * somebody resizes a window to exactly the wrong width.
 *
 * There used to be a documented exception: the architecture graph collapsed into
 * a list at 1024px, a width that was a property of its own drawing. It is gone,
 * and the way it went is worth knowing rather than just recording -- the graph now
 * keeps one fixed layout at every width and a narrow viewport scrolls it, so there
 * is no second arrangement to pick a width for. The tests below insist there is no
 * width query left in that partial, because an exception nobody needs is the same
 * shape as the leftover this file exists to prevent.
