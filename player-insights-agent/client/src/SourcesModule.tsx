/**
 * The one place an answer says where it came from and what to watch for.
 *
 * Sources is a vertical list, one leftover table per bullet, matching Keep in
 * mind's `answer-list` (same blue dots, gap, and type). Filter, metric and
 * window sit inside that source's bullet so they cannot collapse into a wrapping
 * sentence of middle-dot separators.
 *
 * THE ROLE FOLLOWS EACH NAME. That is the fact that differs between sources;
 * repeating a generic governance sentence around every source would bury it.
 *
 * IT TAKES THE WHOLE LIST, and it used to take one source. Both surfaces passed
 * `sources[0]`, so an answer that read four tables named one of them, and the
 * one it named was whichever the run read first -- a dictionary lookup, in the
 * report that started this. Deduplication, ordering and the chip vocabulary are
 * source-rows.ts's; the caveats are KeepInMind.tsx's; this file owns the list.
