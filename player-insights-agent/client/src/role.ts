 *
 * ROLE, THEN WHO, THEN WHAT THEY CAN OPEN, THEN WHO BUILT IT. This is
 * `astrolabe-rebuild-spec.md` §1's cluster, with the signed-in chip restored in
 * place of the initials avatar: "role chip · identity chip · gear · divider ·
 * Built on Databricks". The first pair is the one that has already been
 * corrected once -- the design handoff puts the role badge to the RIGHT of the
 * identity and this app puts it to the LEFT, which was decided directly and is
 * the order the product specification records in sections 4.1 and 10.3. The
 * badge qualifies the reader it precedes. DO NOT REARRANGE THOSE TWO.
 *
 * THE GEAR IS NOW INSIDE THE CLUSTER RATHER THAN AFTER IT, and that is the whole
 * of what moved: it used to close the header from the far right, past the
 * attribution, which put a control belonging to the reader on the other side of
 * the divider that exists to separate the reader from who built the app. It now
 * sits directly after the identity chip, so the divider has identity on one side of it
 * and Databricks on the other, which is what §1 says the divider is for.
 *
 * Gaps between Super admin, the identity chip, and the gear are the row's single
 * 12px gap. Do not add margin on the gear or chip. Super admin itself leaves the
 * top rail while Benchmarking is on the tab row (`showsHeaderRoleBadge`); the
 * signed-in menu still names the rank.
 *
 * It is drawn as a member of `IdentityChips` for that reason, but only in the
 * header copy: the mobile sheet's copy of the cluster is handed no gear, so
 * there is exactly one "App settings" control on the page at any width. Below
 * 800px responsive.css hides the cluster's informational members and keeps the
 * gear, which is what stops a narrow window losing the only way into the page.
 *
 * THE OAUTH BADGE USED TO LEAD THIS ROW AND HAS MOVED RATHER THAN GONE. §1 does
 * not have it in the chrome, and the two surfaces that are actually about the
 * sign-in still state it: the login gate on the way in (`login-gate.md`,
 * Identity block) and the Connections identity card beside the address
 * (`design-spec-master.md` §8). In the header it answered a question nobody had
 * asked, in the row that has to hold the navigation.
 *
 * THE RELEASE CHIP HAS LEFT THIS ROW, and it left for the same reason the OAuth
 * badge did: it is not a fact about the reader. It states which build is on
 * screen, so it is seated beside the app's own name now, in `HeaderBrand`. It
 * was also the member this row could least afford -- second-to-last in the half
 * of the header that gives, which is how a timestamp came to be drawn with its
 * time cut off.
 *
 * The mobile sheet keeps this order, and adds the release chip after the
 * identity chip because below 800px the lockup column has no slack to seat it
 * in. That is the one place the two widths differ, and it differs because at
 * that width the header has no room rather than because anybody reordered it.
