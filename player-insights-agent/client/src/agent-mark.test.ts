/**
 * The agent's mark: one robot, drawn in five places.
 *
 * The transcript's avatar, the chip that introduces the agent on an empty page,
 * and the figure at the end of the working strip are all the same drawing, and
 * this file is what keeps them one drawing. Overview's stored-answer card no
 * longer seats the mark: the live-response badge is the first thing in that
 * card.
 *
 * The claim worth the most here is the boring one: THE MARKUP EXISTS ONCE. A
 * pasted second copy is correct on the day it is pasted, drifts on the first
 * retune of either, and shows nothing at all on screen until somebody who has
 * seen both notices that the loading robot and the answer robot are not quite
 * the same animal -- which nobody will, because the two are never visible
 * together. So the check is not "does the avatar look right", which no test can
 * answer, but "is there anywhere else this geometry could be edited".
 *
 * The rest divides into three:
 *
 *   - The seats. Every place an agent identity mark is drawn draws THIS one, and
 *     none of them has quietly kept a lucide glyph -- which is where this began:
 *     a sparkle beside the answers and a robot in the animation, so the app
 *     introduced itself with one figure and reported with another.
 *   - The window. Derived from the shapes rather than trusted as a string, so a
 *     mark that is off-centre, clipped or scaled unevenly at avatar size fails
 *     here instead of being seen by a customer. This is the part nothing else
 *     can catch: at 32px, four units of misplacement is two pixels.
 *   - The stillness. Only the strip is allowed to move. The mark's classes carry
 *     an antenna pulse and a blink, and both are scoped so that a mark signing a
 *     finished answer does not blink at a reader who has finished reading it --
 *     before `prefers-reduced-motion` is consulted at all, which is the only
 *     honest way to hold that line: a reduced-motion rule stops the reader who
 *     asked, and this stops it for the reader who never thought to.

 * files that no longer seat it. That file is held by the lane recolouring the

 * this one. When they do, this whole file goes too: the seats it guards are gone
 * and the geometry it checks is a drawing nothing renders.
