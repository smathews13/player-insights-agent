/**
 * The rules the Ops tab is not allowed to break, asserted without a browser.
 *
 * Every case here is a way this page could be wrong while looking entirely
 * right, which is the only kind of defect a monitoring surface really has: a
 * page that fails to render gets reported in a minute, and a page that renders a
 * confident wrong number gets acted on.
 *
 * The four properties, and the reason each is worth a test rather than care:
 *
 *  1. A blank is never a zero. Both render as "nothing there" to a glance.
 *  2. Refusals and failures are never summed. The sum is arithmetically valid,
 *     which is exactly why nothing stops somebody producing it.
 *  3. Every figure says how good it is, on itself. A legend elsewhere is
 *     consulted once and then not again.
 *  4. No grant and no rows are different sentences. Empty spend still draws
 *     the resource tiles so a budget can be set; a missing grant still names
 *     the statement that fixes it.
