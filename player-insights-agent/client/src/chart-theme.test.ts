/**
 * A stored chart spec, drawn in the theme that is on screen now.
 *
 * The defect this covers is not subtle and was reported as "the charts are black on
 * black". A spec is written by the agent when the answer is produced and stored beside
 * it, so every colour in it is a light-theme literal: #161616 on the labels, #EBEBEB
 * on the gridlines, white behind the tooltip. Nothing in a stylesheet can reach them
 * -- Plotly draws SVG from a JavaScript object -- so the theme has to be resolved in
 * the object, at draw time, over a copy.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASSERTED HERE AND WHY IT IS THE FUNCTION RATHER THAN THE FIGURE. There is no
 * browser in this repository, so nothing here has seen a chart. What a pure function
 * can be held to is exactly the part that was wrong: which slot took which token, that
 * the answer's own object was not written to, and -- the half that matters more -- that
 * the two enhancements which are more than paint are refused on every shape they would
 * be a lie about. A "peak" on a scatter of two measures against each other is a claim
 * the agent never made, and this file is where that stays true.
