 * just happened.
 *
 * Not simply "is it at the bottom?", because the smooth scroll this decision
 * switches on fires the handler on every frame of its own animation, and every
 * frame but the last is short of the bottom. Reading the gap alone therefore
 * reported the reader as away whenever a step landed mid-animation — which is
 * exactly when steps do land, since one animation is started per step — and
 * that step went unfollowed although nobody had touched the list. What a reader
 * does and what the animation does differ in direction rather than in position,
 * so the upward move is the signal: the animation only ever moves down.
