 * The conversation rail's row, which is now the Run Explorer's recorded-runs card.
 *
 * Two halves, and they fail for different reasons. The collapse from a list of
 * runs to one summary per conversation is arithmetic and is tested as such. The
 * card itself is a stylesheet and a piece of markup: asserted by reading them,
 * because the complaint that produced this pass was about what the rail looked
 * like, and no rendered tree in a jsdom without layout can answer that either.
 * What CAN be pinned is that the parts are present, that the row asks for the run
 * card's own treatment rather than a third one, and that nothing is drawn for a
 * conversation with no run.
