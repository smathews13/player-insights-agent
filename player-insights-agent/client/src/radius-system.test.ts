 * Two radii, and no third, across the whole stylesheet rather than one partial.

 * worth making globally is the failure it would have caught: architecture.css
 * named `var(--radius-lg)` at six call sites and nothing in this app declares it,
 * so the six corners were being drawn by whatever AppKit's imported stylesheet
 * happened to carry -- which turned out to be Tailwind's own default theme, at
 * 0.5rem. It looked right, it tested green, and it was 8px by coincidence rather
 * than by decision. An undefined token is not a subtle bug that shows up as a
 * wrong corner; it is a corner the app does not own, and the next dependency bump
 * is entitled to move it.
 *
 * So the assertion is not "these corners are 8px". It is "every radius this app
 * asks for is one this app declares".
