/**
 * What `SHOW_EVERY_TAB_TO_EVERYONE` actually changes, and what it deliberately
 * does not.
 *
 * The flag was asked for so the whole app could be reviewed without swapping
 * accounts to see half of it. It is a review posture, so the two things worth
 * pinning are that it reveals everything it was meant to, and that it reveals
 * NOTHING ELSE -- in particular that it is navigation only, and that the guard
 * in front of the admin routes is untouched.
 *
 * Read against `nav-role.test.tsx`, which mocks this module to false and asserts
 * the role logic the app returns to when the flag goes back off. Between them
 * both positions of the flag are exercised, which is what makes it one line to
 * reverse rather than one line to reverse and a test run to find out.
 *
 * THIS FILE USES THE REAL VALUE. If the flag is turned off and these tests are
 * left in place they will fail, loudly, naming the flag -- which is the correct
 * outcome: it is the reminder to delete this file, not a reason to soften it.
