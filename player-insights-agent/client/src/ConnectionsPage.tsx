/**
 * What this deployment is connected to, whether it can reach any of it, and
 * what it would take to change each one.
 *
 * This page used to be two. `/sources` reported live dependency checks as seven
 * capability cards, a table matrix and a health card; `/connections` reported
 * the same checks again as resource cards, because the settings route runs the
 * same orchestrator preflight server-side. Identity was on both. Remediation was
 * on both. The two were indistinguishable to the person they were for, who
 * described the settings gear as "just linking to the sources tab", and both
 * were built out of cards carrying roughly one status line each.
 *
 * The spine is now ONE ROW PER CONNECTION. Collapsed, a row is a line: what it
 * is, whether anything reached it, and what it is demonstrably using. Opened, it
 * becomes what used to be a whole card, and only then does it offer a control.
 *
 * The page keeps one rule from before the merge: never show an edit box for a
 * value this app cannot change. Most of what a deployer wants to point at their
 * own workspace, the Genie spaces, the catalog, the warehouse, is baked into the
 * MLflow model artifact at log time, and a form that accepted a new Genie space
 * id and saved it would report success while the orchestrator carried on using
 * the old one. Which affordance a row gets is decided in
 * `shared/deployment-config.ts` rather than here.

/**
 * ONE REMEDY, STATED ONCE, over every cause it clears.
 *
 * WHAT THIS BLOCK USED TO BE. It was one block per failing item, and on this
 * deployment a single stale sign-in refuses four API families at once. So the
 * panel printed the same three-line instruction about private browsing windows
 * four times over, plus the same sentence about signing out of Databricks, and a
 * reader crossed roughly twenty lines of identical advice to learn one thing:
 * that there is one move, and it clears all of it. Which the page never actually
 * said. Before that it was worse -- one block per CHECK, so twelve tables meant
 * twelve copies.
 *
 * Now the remedy is the block and the causes are rows in it. The sentences every
 * cause shares are lifted above them and said once; each cause keeps the one
 * sentence that is about it.
 *
 * The grouping itself is in `connection-causes.ts`, deliberately away from the
 * markup, so which checks belong together is assertable without composing a
 * screen and the page cannot grow a second reading of it. A block of one cause
 * renders what a single check rendered before: the label, the chip, the sentence
 * and the remedy.
 *
 * Exported for rendering, not for reuse: nothing else on the app composes one.
 * A page render under `renderToStaticMarkup` runs no effects, so
 * `ConnectionsPage` itself only ever composes its empty state in a test and this
 * panel is unreachable from there. The alternative was asserting the panel's
 * source text, and this repository has twice shipped a wrong screen past exactly
 * that kind of assertion -- including a source row whose separator was missing
 * while every claim about the file was true.
