/**
 * The plan card names tables and columns, and now says which is which.
 *
 * The card used to render its summary and every step through `EntityText` with
 * `sources={[]}`, which is the empty candidate set: nothing in a plan could
 * match anything, so every table and every column in it was grey text a reader
 * had to copy out and look up by hand. That is the defect these tests pin, and
 * they pin it at both ends -- the segmentation the renderer is handed, and the
 * call sites in the component that ask for it.
 *
 * They cannot say what the card looks like. There is no browser in this repo,
 * so what is asserted is that the right function is called with the right
 * candidate set and that its output marks the runs a reader needs marked. See
 * answer-geometry.test.ts, which makes the same trade for the same reason.
