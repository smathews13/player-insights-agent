/**
 * Which Databricks product a thing on screen belongs to, and the official mark
 * that says so. One map, for the whole application.
 *
 * The handoff's rule is short: a brand icon renders wherever the UI names a
 * Databricks product or a resource owned by one -- a row, a tile, a chip, an
 * architecture node, a step in a plan. Lucide line icons keep the actions and the
 * generic concepts, the refreshes and carets and padlocks. Never both on one
 * element, and never a Lucide glyph standing in for a product.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS THE ONLY PLACE A PRODUCT IS PAIRED WITH ITS ARTWORK. Before it,
 * `TraceDag.tsx` held its own three-product map inlined at the top of a 600-line
 * component, which is how the agent map came to chip Unity Catalog with a DuBois
 * document glyph: the mapping lived where only the person editing that component
 * would ever read it. A second copy of the pairing is the same bug waiting, and
 * it is invisible, because two marks for one product are never on screen
 * together for anyone to compare.
 *
 * ## Adding a product
 *
 * 1. Put the official SVG in `assets/brand/` under its published filename. Get
 *    it from the brand asset library; do not export one from a slide, do not
 *    take a DuBois interface glyph, and do not redraw it. Read that folder's
 *    README before you copy anything into it.
 * 2. Add the slug to `BrandProduct`, and an entry to each of the three records
 *    below. TypeScript will not let you forget one -- they are all keyed on the
 *    union, which is the point of writing them as three records rather than one
 *    object of triples.
 * 3. If it is a wordmark rather than a square icon, add it to `WORDMARKS`, which
 *    is what stops it being squashed into a box.
 * 4. `brand-icons.test.ts` covers the rest: it will fail until the file exists,
 *    is the artwork it claims to be, and renders for its slug.
 *
 * If the design asks for a product whose SVG nobody has, say so and leave a
 * Lucide glyph there. An approximate mark is worse than an honest one, because a
 * reader who knows the real marks reads the lookalike as one and is then wrong
 * about which product they are looking at.

// The published files themselves, inlined rather than redrawn as JSX paths. A
// copy of a drawing starts out identical and is then tidied, re-indented or
// "fixed" by somebody with nothing to compare it against; imported raw, the
// committed asset IS what renders, and a test can read the file off disk and
// find it in the markup.
//
// TWO SETS, AND THE SECOND IS WHAT RENDERS. `assets/brand/` is the official
// full-colour artwork, which is now the record of the GEOMETRY rather than the
// thing on screen: `assets/logo/theme/` holds the same paths with the fills
// substituted for the astrolabe palette, and the app draws those. Example User
// settled that on 2026-08-17 -- recolouring is permitted, redrawing is not --
// and the ruling is written into both asset READMEs. The full-colour set stays
// imported because it is what the recolour is checked AGAINST: brand-icons.test
// strips every `fill` from both and requires the remainder to be identical, so
// a "recoloured" file that quietly moved a node fails here rather than on a
// customer's screen. That check is the only mechanical guard the never-redraw
// half of the ruling has.
