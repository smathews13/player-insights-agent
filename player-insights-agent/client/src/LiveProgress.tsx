/**
 * The run as it happens, in the card that used to hold two empty skeletons.

 * - Nothing is drawn that the run did not report. There is no placeholder row
 *   for a step in flight, because the endpoint has not said which step that is
 *   and a plausible guess beside real rows makes a reader doubt the real ones.
 * - Every step reported is drawn. The rail this replaces subsampled to four
 *   evenly spread stages once a run passed four steps, so a twenty-one step run
 *   showed four of them and silently dropped seventeen: the opposite of what
 *   a live view is for.
 * - The list grows inside the bounded live answer card. It never creates a
 *   second vertical viewport inside that pane.
