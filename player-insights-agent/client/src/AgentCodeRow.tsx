/**
 * One row in Settings: where to read the code that is answering.
 *
 * WHY THE ROW EXISTS. `agent.py` is the whole orchestrator -- the prompts, the
 * refusals, the field binding -- and it is not in this app. It is an artifact of
 * the registered model version the serving endpoint answers out of, so a reader
 * evaluating an answer had no way from inside the product to see the code that
 * produced it. They had to be told a catalog, a schema, a model and a version by
 * somebody, in a message, and then find it by hand.
 *
 * WHY IT NAMES THE ARTIFACTS TAB IN WORDS. The link goes to the model version
 * page, which is as deep as a Databricks URL goes: the tabs on that page --
 * Overview, Lineage, Artifacts, Traces -- are not separately addressable as far
 * as this app can establish, and a made-up query parameter would land on
 * Overview while claiming to land on the file. So the row says which tab, and
 * the link puts the reader one click from it.
 *
 * WHY IT CAN SAY NOTHING. A deployment whose endpoint would not describe itself,
 * or that was never told its own workspace host, has no address for its own
 * code. That is reported as not established rather than papered over with a link
 * to a workspace that may not be the reader's -- the rule the whole of
 * `databricks-links.ts` exists to hold.
