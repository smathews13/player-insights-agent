/**
 * Run Explorer: every recorded run, and one run's trace read four ways.
 *
 * Split out of App.tsx when the pages became modules. `TraceUnavailable` comes
 * with it and stays unexported: it is this page's way of saying why a pane is
 * empty, and nothing else has ever rendered it.
 *
 * The Timeline tab used to be a second timing view, `Waterfall`, written here.
 * It is the shared `TraceTimeline` now, the one the answer card draws, and the
 * old one is deleted rather than restyled to resemble it. Two views of one
 * measurement is how this page came to disagree with the answer it was opened
 * from: the waterfall floored a bar at 4% of the track so a label would fit
 * inside it, and scaled the axis to the last stage's end rather than the run's
 * measured envelope, so a step that took 1% of the run drew four times too wide
 * against a total the run never reported. What Run Explorer gains by sharing is
 * everything the answer's panel already had: the roll-up by tool type, and a row
 * that opens onto the arguments and result the agent recorded.

/** Stages whose time belongs to data work, including older traces that tagged

/**
 * How much of a run was data work, as a figure that fits inside the run.
 *
 * This read 184.6s on a run whose wall clock was 152.3s, which is not a
 * measurement of anything: it was the same milliseconds counted twice over. The
 * agent records a tree, not a list. `data_source_finder` is one stage spanning
 * the whole discovery phase, and inside it sit the `step-n` model turns and,
 * inside those, every tool call the model asked for. Adding the parent to its
 * own children charges the run for the finder's span plus a second copy of
 * everything that happened during it, and the finder's name matches the pattern
 * above, so it was always in the sum.
 *
 * So parents are dropped and only the innermost data stages are counted, which
 * is also the honest reading of the label: the finder's span includes the model
 * calls that chose the steps, and those are not data work. What is left is
 * unioned rather than added, because a step's tool calls can run in parallel.
 *
 * `wallMs` is the run's own duration, the figure the tile beside this one
 * prints. Where the union is exact the union cannot exceed it, so the bound
 * only ever applies on the fallback path below, where starts were never
 * recorded and there is nothing to union: a sum of parallel leaves is capped at
 * the run it happened inside rather than published as a longer run than
 * happened.
