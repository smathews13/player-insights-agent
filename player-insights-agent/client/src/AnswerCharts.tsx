/**
 * One Plotly panel from the agent's `new_plot` tool.

 * Mirrors `Chart` in agent/contracts.py and `ChartSchema` in
 * server/routes/insights-routes.ts. `data` and `layout` are Plotly's own free-form
 * shapes, validated as objects at the route and carried here untouched.
 *
 * UNTOUCHED IS LITERAL AND IT IS WHY THIS FILE STILL DECLARES NO COLOUR. The agent
 * writes the palette into the spec, and the spec is stored, so its colours are the
 * light theme's whatever theme is on screen when it is read back. Resolving that is a
 * pure pass over a COPY of the spec, in plotly-config.ts, applied by PlotlyFigure at
 * draw time -- not a second palette written into the panel here, and not an edit to
 * the answer object the transcript and the Run Explorer both hold.
 *
 * What this file owns is the panel: a surface, a compact eyebrow title, and the
 * boundary that keeps a chart which will not draw from taking the answer with it.
 * Everything inside the plot, the series key included, is Plotly's.
