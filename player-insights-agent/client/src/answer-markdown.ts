/**
 * The Markdown the agent writes, as a tree the answer card can render.
 *
 * The orchestrator has always written Markdown. It was authored against a
 * notebook, where `## DATA PACKAGE` is a heading and `- **Interpretation:**` is
 * a bulleted lead-in, and the app rendered both as the literal characters the
 * agent typed. Worse than ugly: `white-space` is not `pre-wrap` on the
 * narrative, so newlines collapsed too and a heading landed mid-sentence.
 *
 * WHY A PARSER HERE RATHER THAN A LIBRARY. Two reasons, and the second is the
 * one that decided it.
 *
 * 1. This output is untrusted. It is written by a model, crosses a serving
 *    endpoint, and lands in a customer's browser. The usual pipeline renders
 *    Markdown to an HTML string and then sanitises it, which is safe only for
 *    as long as the sanitiser's denylist keeps pace. There is no HTML string
 *    anywhere in this module. The tree below has five inline shapes and a small
 *    family of block shapes, none of which carries markup, so a `<script>` in the source
 *    has nowhere to go but a text run, and React escapes text runs. Raw HTML is
 *    not sanitised here, it is unrepresentable.
 *
 * 2. Entity linking has to survive. `linkifyEntities` used to run over one flat
 *    string; over a tree it has to run over the text inside the tree, or a
 *    table named in a heading or in bold silently stops linking. A library
 *    hands back rendered output, and reaching into it to re-segment its text
 *    nodes is more code than parsing the constructs we support, with the
 *    library's whole surface still shipping to the customer.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT SUPPORTED. Underscore emphasis, above all: every
 * table this app links has underscores in it, and `_`-delimited emphasis would
 * eat `gold_title_daily_summary` and hand back a half-italic fragment that no
 * longer matches anything. Also absent: block quotes, images and backslash
 * escapes. Anything unsupported survives as the characters the
 * agent wrote, which is what the app did with all of it before this module
 * existed.
 *
 * TABLES ARE SUPPORTED, and they were the last construct in this list that the
 * agent writes on nearly every quantitative answer. An answer that aggregated
 * three weeks of sessions by day put its six columns on screen as the pipes and
 * the dashes the model typed -- `| Date | Sessions |` and a row of `---` under
 * it -- which is the same defect this module was written for, one construct
 * later, and the worst instance of it: a table is the one shape whose whole
 * value is that the figures line up, and unrendered it is the shape that reads
 * worst as plain text. See `tableBlock` below for what counts as one.
