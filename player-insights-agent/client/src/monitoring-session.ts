/**
 * The Monitoring questions list, kept for as long as the app is loaded.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG. The page held its payload in `useState`. React unmounts a
 * route on navigation, so leaving Monitoring and coming back re-ran the
 * questions query -- the one that scans every message in the range -- with
 * nobody asking for it. Refresh already exists for that.
 *
 * ONCE PER SESSION PER REQUEST, NOT ONCE PER VISIT. A request is the normalized
 * range, active filters, and opaque page cursor. The claim is taken from
 * {@link claimAutoLoad} before any fetch is issued. So:
 *
 *   - a second mount of the same range does not re-run it
 *   - React's development double-mount does not re-run it
 *   - an automatic run that FAILED does not re-run it on the next visit
 *   - a different range, filter set, or cursor gets its own first read
 *
 * The last-but-one is the one that is easy to get wrong by keying on the store
 * instead of on a latch: a deployment whose list cannot be read would retry the
 * expensive scan on every navigation, forever, with no button pressed.
 *
 * After the automatic run, Refresh is the only thing that reads the list again.
 *
 * WHY A MODULE-LEVEL STORE RATHER THAN THE OTHER THREE OPTIONS. Same reasons
 * as `check-session.ts`. Not a provider (nothing above the page needs this).
 * Not sessionStorage (results must not outlive this running copy of the app).
 * Not a refetch on mount (that is the behaviour this exists to stop).
 *
 * A RUN IN FLIGHT IS VISIBLE TO WHOEVER IS LOOKING. The subscriber list is
 * not decoration. A reader who opens Monitoring and switches away two seconds
 * later must see that run land when they come back, not an empty page that
 * has given up waiting for a fetch it never made.
