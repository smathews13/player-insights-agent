/**
 * What the access gate's shape has to keep saying.
 *
 * It is the app's only real modal, and the first thing a new reader ever sees, so
 * two of the revamp's rules meet here and pull in opposite directions. Nothing in
 * the app floats or is translucent any more -- but a modal scrim is translucent by
 * definition, because it is showing you the page you are being held back from, and
 * a dialog that does not float is not a dialog. Both exceptions are deliberate and
 * both are narrow: the scrim and the panel's shadow, and nothing else on the
 * screen.
 *
 * The rest is about which of three states may be coloured. A refusal is red, the
 * limits of the check are amber, and the gate itself -- a question the app asks
 * everybody, every time -- is ordinary chrome. Getting that wrong in either
 * direction is the same defect: a screen where the reader cannot tell whether
 * anything has actually gone wrong.
 *
 * Read against the stylesheet, in the pattern palette.test.ts established, because
 * this repo has no jsdom. What a browser would have to confirm is in the handover.

 * Everything one selector declares, and a throw rather than an empty string when
 * the selector is absent. Several assertions here are negative -- that a rule does
 * NOT paint red, that it is NOT translucent -- and a missing selector would satisfy
 * every one of them while the screen said nothing at all.
 *
 * Every matching block, not the first: `.access-gate-raw pre` is declared once
 * alongside the remedy panel and again on its own to take back the one property
 * the two panels disagree about. Reading only the first block would be reading half
 * of what the browser will apply.
