 * describing checks drifts from the checks. Everything a report or a runbook
 * needs to say about a check is a field here, and the runner cannot emit a
 * result for a code this file does not define.
 *
 * FOUR STATUSES, NOT TWO. `unknown` and `unverifiable` exist because this
 * deployment has repeatedly been damaged by a green tick that meant "nobody
 * asked". The bundle's own preflight check already draws the same distinction in
 * prose and says why; this makes it a value the aggregation has to handle.
 *
 *   pass          observed, and the observation is what we wanted.
 *   fail          observed, and it is wrong.
 *   unknown       the check ran and could not establish an answer THIS TIME.
 *                 A workspace that could not be reached, an app with no
 *                 deployment yet, a probe that is not built. Transient or
 *                 pending, not evidence of health.
 *   unverifiable  there is no observation that could establish it AT ALL. Not
 *                 today, not with more effort in this file. The only way to a
 *                 PASS is a human stating what they did (see `attestation`).
 *
 * A certificate is PASS only when every required check is `pass`, or is
 * `unverifiable` with a matching attestation. Anything else is FAIL or
