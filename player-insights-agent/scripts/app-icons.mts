/**
 * The app icons: the PIA simplified/engraved D-pad on its navy plate.
 *
 *     npx tsx scripts/app-icons.mts            # rewrite client/public
 *     npx tsx scripts/app-icons.mts --out /tmp # somewhere else, to compare
 *
 * The tab used to show a dark plate with "T2" on it, which was the partner's
 * initials standing in for an app that had no identity of its own. It has one:
 * the header, the login gate, the loaders and the agent chips all draw the
 * d-pad, and the tab was the last surface still naming the customer instead.
 *
 * DRAWN FROM THE APP'S OWN GEOMETRY, WHICH IS THE POINT OF THIS FILE EXISTING
 * AT ALL. Every coordinate comes from `piaMarkElements` in
 * client/src/pia-mark.ts -- the same array the component renders, pinned
 * to the delivered PIA SVGs by pia-mark.test.tsx. So "never redraw, never
 * restroke" holds here by construction rather than by a second person's care:
 * there is no copy of the mark in this file to drift, and a change to the
 * delivered artwork reaches the favicon by regenerating rather than by
 * somebody remembering that the favicon exists.
 *
 * Browser-tab candidates are all drawn with the simplified cut. A 32px or 48px
 * source bitmap is still painted into a roughly 16px browser-tab seat on a
 * high-density display, so choosing the engraving from the source bitmap size
 * makes the face glyphs collapse into a round controller button. Install and
 * touch icons retain the canonical engraved cut at their much larger seats.
 *
 * WHY A PLATE AT ALL, given the delivered SVGs are ink on transparency. A tab
 * strip is a surface the app does not control and does not know the colour of.
 * The navy plate is the mark's dark seating from pia-brand.css --
 * white structure, #6FAEDD accents -- which is a seating the design already
 * has, and it reads on a light strip and a dark one alike. Ink on transparency
 * reads on exactly one of them, and Chrome's dark chrome is the one it loses.
 * The plate also keeps the tab's silhouette unchanged: the rounded dark square
 * that was there yesterday, with this app's mark on it instead of a customer's
 * initials.
 *
 * Rasterised with `sharp`, which is already a devDependency. It is a build-time
 * tool and nothing ships it: the six PNGs it writes are committed, and
 * client/public is copied verbatim into client/dist by vite.
