"""The scope contract's MODEL leg, for the model release path.

Arch#3 asks for one generated scope contract consumed by BOTH release paths. Only
one consumed it. `bundle/app-release.sh` runs `scope-contract.py --check --live`
against the app object, which answers the app's three legs and says nothing at all
about the model's -- and the model's scopes are a DIFFERENT TOKEN, set by a
different policy, validated by a different validator, on a different release. The
contract has recorded that distinction since it was written; nothing tested it.

WHAT THIS ASKS, which the app path cannot:

  the scopes THIS TARGET would bake      agent/user_authorization.py derives them
                                         from the target's Genie ids and warehouse,
                                         and agent/log_model.py adds the Vector
                                         Search pair when an index is configured
  the scopes the contract DOCUMENTS      `model_scopes`, with the condition each
                                         is asked under
  the scopes the LIVE model version HAS  `api_scopes` in the release summary the
                                         last log_model run printed, when given

The first two need no workspace, so this is the CI form. The third is `--logged`,
taking the JSON `log_model.py` prints, and is what a release can add.

THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR is not hypothetical: `api_scopes()` returns Genie and
SQL only, and the Vector Search pair is added in log_model.py under a condition
`api_scopes` cannot see. Two places, one list, and the contract documenting a
third version of it. A target that configures an index and no warehouse gets a
scope set no file states in full.

    bundle/model-scope-check.py --target example
    bundle/model-scope-check.py --target example --logged release-summary.json

    0  the model legs agree
    1  a finding: they disagree
    2  the check could not run, which is NOT agreement
