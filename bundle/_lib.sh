# an empty string to python, burying the real message under a JSONDecodeError
# traceback. The cache needs the same thing: an assignment made inside `$(...)` is
# discarded, so a reader that loaded for itself would re-run `bundle validate`
# every time.
#

# process, and a release is several: app-release.sh runs preflight.sh and
# certify-release.sh as children, agent-release.sh does the same, and each child
# resolved the identical target from scratch. Measured on this bundle, `bundle
# validate` costs 7.5 seconds, so one applied app release spent ~23 seconds
