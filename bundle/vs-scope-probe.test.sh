# Proof that bundle/vs-scope-probe.py fails on each of the three questions it asks.
#
# Driven by fabricated API replies through --responses, so it needs no workspace
# and gives the same answer every time. The declared leg edits databricks.yml for
# real, because the claim of that leg is that it reads the target's list.
#
# WHY THE SHAPE CASES MATTER MOST. Declared and reachable are both satisfiable by
# configuration. The synthetic invocation is the one that fails when the scope is
# spelled in a way the validator accepts and the API does not honour -- which is
# the shape of the two failures this repository has actually had here: a coarse
# scope name the Apps API rejected outright, and a probe path refused at runtime
# whose symptom was a GRANT statement printed at a reader who already had access.
