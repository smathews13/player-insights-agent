# Emit the COMPLETE Databricks App spec for a target, and optionally apply it.
#
# This exists because `databricks apps update` has REPLACE semantics on the whole
# app spec. A partial body drops the attached resources, and a dropped `postgres`
# attachment does not merely disconnect: Lakebase DROPS the app's Postgres role,
# and a reattach creates a new role of the same name that inherits none of the
# grants, because privileges hang off the role's OID. One careless `apps update`
# costs an attachment, a role, and every grant on it.
#
# So the recovery from that needs a body that is always complete, and DERIVED
# rather than stored: generated from `bundle validate` for a named target, so the
# only values it can contain are that target's own and the scopes are the bundle's
# scopes because there is nowhere else for them to come from.
#
# DO NOT REINTRODUCE A CHECKED-IN SPEC FILE. Nothing forces a second copy of this
# configuration to agree with the first, and the two things a stale copy gets
# wrong while still looking correct are the Lakebase identifiers, which would
# attach a customer app to another workspace database, and the user_api_scopes
# list, which would drop scopes and break the access gate.
#
# Usage:
#   TARGET=<your-target>                            bundle/app-spec.sh            # print
#   TARGET=<your-target>                            bundle/app-spec.sh --apply
#   TARGET=customer PROFILE=<their-profile> bundle/app-spec.sh --apply
#
# TARGET has no default here, and that is deliberate even though databricks.yml
# does mark one target as `default: true`. A script that fell through to the
# bundle's default would aim a customer's recovery at whichever target happens to
# carry that flag rather than at the one they meant.
#
# PREFER THE BUNDLE. `bundle deploy` owns this resource and cannot produce a
# partial update either. Reach for this only when the bundle is not an option:
# recovering a wiped spec, or attaching resources to an app that was created
# outside the bundle (the git-deploy path).

# here would be a second copy of a value bundle/app-release.sh already owns.

# quietly drops a load-bearing field stops this script instead of shipping a
# partial spec with replace semantics behind it.

Done. Two things this did NOT do, and both matter:

  1. Postgres grants are not restored by this. If the `postgres` resource had
     been detached, its role was DROPPED and the reattach made a new one with
     nothing granted to it. Re-run the grants:
       cd player-insights-agent && node scripts/grant-app-db-access.mjs
  2. Adding a user_api_scope needs a full app stop and start to take effect. A
     redeploy leaves it inert.

Verify against the LIVE app, not against psql. A psql session proves the grants
exist, not that the app picked them up:
  curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(databricks auth token --profile "<profile>" | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["access_token"])')" \
    "$APP_URL/api/storage"
