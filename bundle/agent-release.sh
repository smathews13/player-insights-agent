# --- Does this release agree with what somebody saved in the app? ------------
#
# The failure this closes: a deployer opens the app, saves their warehouse id as
# the value they intend this deployment to use, and is told to run this script.
# They run it, from a laptop whose variable-overrides.json says something else. A
# model is logged with the OTHER value, and the app goes on reporting that
# resource as having an intended value that is not in effect, forever, with no
# explanation of why running the suggested command did not close it.
#
# Nothing is wrong with either half. The bundle is authoritative about what gets
# logged, and it should be. The app is honest that saving an intended value binds
# nothing, and it should be. What was missing is that the two were never
# compared, so a disagreement between them was silent, and silence is what every
# expensive failure in this system has in common.
#
# This does not make the app authoritative. It refuses, and says which value came
# from where. The deployer decides which one is right and fixes THAT, rather than
# discovering months later that a value somebody recorded described a workspace
# nobody deployed to.
#
# The machine reader joins each stored resource id to the same `agentKey`
# contract the app publishes. Its regression test compares that map against
# shared/deployment-config.ts so a new stageable setting cannot disappear here.
#
# Do not read the browser route here. Databricks Apps requires both proxy
# identity and the app-session cookie for `/api/settings`; a workspace OAuth
# token alone correctly receives 401. The release operator instead connects to
# the app-owned Lakebase branch with a short-lived OAuth database credential,
# the same secure machine path app-db-grant.sh already uses. There is no route,
# cookie, hardcoded token, or unchecked fallback in this gate.

Dry run. Nothing was logged or deployed.

Re-run with --apply to:
  1. cd agent && uv run --python 3.13 python log_model.py
     (logs a new version, registers it in UC, points the 'prod' alias at it.
      The alias is a signpost; step 2 deploys by explicit version number)
  2. uv run --python 3.13 python deploy_agent.py --model-version <new>
  3. wait 60s for the traffic switch to settle
  4. smoke-test the endpoint
  5. remove superseded entities from the endpoint, keeping what serves plus
     $ROLLBACKS_KEPT idle rollback(s) (var.serving_rollbacks_kept). This is a
     change to the ENDPOINT only: every version stays registered in Unity
     Catalog and can be served again with deploy_agent.py --model-version N,
     which is the rollback path whether or not an idle entity is kept.
     Pass --no-prune to leave them, in which case the run reports what it
     would have removed rather than staying quiet about it.

Before --apply, confirm the model's declared resources still cover every table
both Genie spaces curate. A table outside the manifest fails nothing loudly: the
space fails every call with a passthrough credential error, and the agent's SQL
fallback answers anyway, so the endpoint looks healthy while it has stopped using
Genie at all.
See the manifest a log would declare, and every table it excludes with the
reason, without logging anything:
  (cd agent && uv run --python 3.13 python manifest_dryrun.py)

log_model.py stops if this release would declare tables the live version does not,
because it cannot tell a widening somebody chose from a catalog_denylist that went
missing. Reaching wider is often right. Record the decision with:
  --allow-widening
If the wider list is NOT what you want, narrow it in catalog_denylist rather than
by leaving the flag off, which narrows the agent and says nothing about why.
