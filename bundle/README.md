# `bundle/`: the imperative steps

All of these default to a dry run. `--apply` executes.

**Read `DECISIONS.md` before changing a target's variables.** It records the
standing product decisions a release must not contradict, each with the date it
was taken and a sentence of reason. A decision that needs to change is changed in
that file, deliberately, rather than drifting.

`decisions-gate.py` holds a release's resolved configuration against the
machine-checkable ones and stops the release, naming the decision and its date,
before anything irreversible happens. There is no bypass flag, on purpose. The
decisions it can only display rather than enforce are printed beside the
configuration and marked as displayed in both places, because a check that
implied more coverage than it has would be worse than none.

**Both release scripts now call it, and there is no path around it.** In
`agent-release.sh` it runs immediately after the configuration readout and before
anything is exported to `log_model.py`; in `app-release.sh` it runs before the
rollback branch and before the dry-run branch, so a dry run and a rollback are both
held to it. A dry run reports it deliberately: a dry run is where somebody checks a
target before committing to it, and a gate that only spoke on `--apply` would stay
quiet at the one moment it is cheap to act on.

`genie-drift.sh` answers a different and narrower question: does the Genie
content committed under `genie/` still match what the workspace is serving? It
reads and changes nothing, so it is safe to run mid-deploy or mid-demo. Exit 0
means the reference bodies and the live spaces agree; exit 1 means they do not.

It compares the TEXT rather than `serialized_space.version` or the instruction
ids. The spaces themselves are **not** bundle-managed any more: this bundle
attaches by id and does not overwrite instructions or curated tables on deploy.
Use the drift check when you deliberately want to know whether a reference body
and the live space have diverged; fixing drift is a Genie UI (or reference
re-export) step, not a `bundle deploy`.

What it cannot tell you is whether an instruction that landed is being **followed**.
Those look identical from outside; ask the space a question that depends on the
change. Whether the curated tables fall inside `data_catalogs` is enforced when
the model is logged (`agent/preflight.py`), not by a separate live-check script.

`TARGET` is required and has no default: guessing one aims a release at a
workspace. `PROFILE` is optional for a target that names its CLI profile in
`databricks.yml`, since it is read back from there; every other target must state
one (`PROFILE=<their-profile>`). If a profile name contains a space, keep it
quoted wherever you pass it.

## Deployment order on a fresh workspace

Internal and customer targets use the same sequence. Start with one complete,
interactive bundle reconciliation, including the App, then release the model
and app code:

0. Provision Lakebase (project / branch / database) and curate the two Genie
   spaces **outside** this bundle. Name them in
   `.databricks/bundle/<target>/variable-overrides.json`
   (`lakebase_project_id`, `genie_data_space_id`, `genie_dictionary_space_id`,
   plus `warehouse_id`, `admin_emails`, and the other required inputs).
   If this deploy recreates a deleted App against a retained Lakebase database,
   also set `lakebase_app_schema` to a new, unused schema. A recreated App has a
   new service principal and cannot own the prior App's schema. The app release
   ownership gate refuses that old schema; keep it for deliberate migration
   rather than deleting it to unblock the release.

   This ignored file is the durable bundle configuration contract for one
   checkout. Bundle commands resolve variables in this order, highest
   precedence first: `--var`, `BUNDLE_VAR_*`,
   `.databricks/bundle/<target>/variable-overrides.json`, target variables, then
   tracked defaults. Normal pull, checkout, validation, deploy, agent-release,
   app-release, and Apply paths do not write or delete it.

   Git never transfers ignored files. A new clone, new machine, or replacement
   working directory needs a secure copy or a newly created
   `.databricks/bundle/<target>/variable-overrides.json`. Shell environment
   variables are one-run overrides, not persistent storage.

   An app-code update is still the established one-step **Deploy from Git** flow
   on the existing Databricks App. It does not read this local file, and does
   not need to: it does not replace the App, service principal, resource
   bindings, OAuth scopes, telemetry destinations, or Lakebase state that the
   bundle already configured. Deployment-level environment variables configured
   on the App deployment override matching values in the committed
   `build/deploy/app.yaml`; `valueFrom` entries continue to resolve through the
   unchanged resource bindings. The committed manifest supplies only the
   fallback for values without a deployment override. Do not run
   `bundle/app-release.sh` as part of a Git update.
1. Run the deployment:

   ```bash
   TARGET=<target> PROFILE='<profile>' bash bundle/deploy.sh
   TARGET=<target> PROFILE='<profile>' bundle/agent-release.sh --apply
   TARGET=<target> PROFILE='<profile>' bundle/app-release.sh --apply
   ```

   Do not create the App by hand, exclude it with `--select`, or introduce a
   Terraform-engine path. The App is bundle-owned; `app-release.sh` remains the
   code and database-grant release after the bundle creates it.

If the deploy says its lock is held after an earlier deploy crashed or was
interrupted, first confirm no deploy is still running, then retry through the
same wrapper with its guarded stale-lock override:

```bash
PLAYER_INSIGHTS_AGENT_CONFIRMED_NO_LIVE_DEPLOY=true \
  TARGET=<target> PROFILE=<profile> \
  bash bundle/deploy.sh --force-lock
```

Do not make `--force-lock` the normal deploy command: it disables the protection
against two deploys changing the same bundle state concurrently.

Do **not** create an app shell against a temporary old endpoint, rewrite
`variable-overrides.json` mid-deploy, or use `--allow-missing-endpoint`. Those
were workarounds for a deleted gate.

Two inputs outside the app release still need an operator. The administrator
input fails validation when skipped; Genie sharing still requires review.

- **Name the deployment's administrators**, before step 4, because there is no
  way to appoint the first one from inside the running app:

  ```bash
  # .databricks/bundle/<target>/variable-overrides.json, which is git-ignored
  { "admin_emails": "super:someone@example.com" }
  ```

  `admin_emails` is a required bundle variable, and the app release also rejects
  an explicitly empty value. Without those checks, the app would start and
  refuse every caller on Monitoring, Ops and the settings gear with a 403.
  **The admin-list editor that would fix it is behind the same refusal, so that
  deployment would be self-locking and the only way out would be another
  release.**

  The value must not go in `databricks.yml`, which is tracked and published: an
  address is a personal name and an employer, and both are on the publication's
  sensitive list. `databricks.yml` declares `admin_emails` without a default so
  validation requires a private override. `PLAYER_INSIGHTS_ADMIN_EMAILS` in the
  environment wins over the file for a one-off that should not change what the
  target records.

  App boot writes this config into Lakebase only when the role roster is
  genuinely empty. Once any role row exists, Lakebase is the only runtime source
  of truth and deployment config is ignored. A later app-code deploy with stale,
  different, or empty admin config cannot change any super-admin, admin, or
  consumer role.

  **`build/deploy/app.yaml` is where the addresses actually land, and it is
  tracked.** The release uploads the local build tree directly, so the container
  gets the list without a commit. Do not commit it:
  `git restore -- ':(glob)*/build/deploy/app.yaml'`. The build prints
  the same warning, and this root-relative check fails while deployment values are there:

  ```bash
  git diff --exit-code HEAD -- ':(glob)*/build/deploy/app.yaml'
  ```

  **That check catches this before the commit**, so do not
  skip it to get one through. The mirror leak check still blocks on the
  addresses, but it gates the publication and no longer scans the internal tree,
  which puts it after the commit rather than before it.

- **The app release grants the app's Postgres role automatically**, after the
  bundle has created the app service principal and immediately before the code
  deploy that restarts it. `bundle/app-db-grant.sh` reads the app role, attached
  branch and database from the live app, reads `PGHOST` from the branch's direct
  connection (`databricks postgres get-branch`, never the pooled AppKit host),
  and uses the profile's current identity as `PGUSER`. The profile must hold
  `DATABRICKS_SUPERUSER`; an unreachable branch or failed grant stops the
  release with the values it could not resolve.

  The hook also drops a misowned AppKit cache schema (`appkit`).
  `GRANT USAGE, CREATE` alone cannot fix later `CREATE INDEX` ownership
  failures. It is idempotent and leaves an app-owned cache schema alone.

  After a Lakebase detach/reattach when no full app release is otherwise needed,
  run the same hook as the manual escape hatch, then restart the app:

  ```bash
  TARGET=<target> PROFILE='<profile>' bundle/app-db-grant.sh
  databricks apps stop <app-name> --profile '<profile>'
  databricks apps start <app-name> --profile '<profile>'
  ```

  Skipped, every route answers from representative data at HTTP 200 with no
  error anywhere, and AppKit's persistent cache stays in-memory across restarts.

- **Share each Genie space with the people or groups who will use the app, at
  `CAN RUN`.** With `execution_identity: user-authorization`, Genie runs as the
  person who asked, not as the app or serving-endpoint service principal.
  Skipped, every Genie call fails `PermissionDenied` and the agent's SQL fallback
  answers anyway. Those same callers also need `CAN USE` on the warehouse and
  `SELECT` on the curated tables, because Genie's query runs under their grants.
  There is no bundle resource for the grant, but there **is** a CLI, so it need
  not be a UI step:

  ```bash
  databricks permissions update genie <space_id> \
    --json '{"access_control_list":[{"user_name":"someone@example.com","permission_level":"CAN_RUN"}]}'
  ```

  Do **not** grant the _serving-endpoint_ principal `CAN RUN`: that was the old
  passthrough remedy, and under user authorization it grants nothing the caller
  needs.

Identity split (do not re-introduce an app-SP Unity Catalog data gate on release):

- **Signed-in user**: governed UC / Genie / SQL reads (`execution_identity: user-authorization`).
- **App service principal**: app-owned Lakebase operational storage and non-data control-plane work only. Lakebase grants are checked after app creation (`scripts/grant-app-db-access.mjs`, `/api/storage`, app-release ownership), not by asking UC what the SP can `SELECT` on customer catalogs.

## Player Insights Agent brand and state identities

The user-visible and operator-visible identity is one contract:

- display name: `Player Insights Agent`;
- bundle, App, serving endpoint, and path slug: `player-insights-agent`;
- registered model object: `${app_catalog}.${app_schema}.player_insights_agent`;
- MLflow experiment: `/Shared/player-insights-agent`;
- resource billing dimension: `system_billing=player-insights-agent`;
- mutable Workspace staging directory: `player-insights-agent-src`.

AI Search endpoint custom tags are the one platform-constrained exception.
Where supported, Vector Search rejects hyphens and therefore uses the equivalent
token `system_billing=player_insights_agent`. Workspaces whose AI Search API
does not support custom tags log and skip that endpoint; all other supported
resource types keep the canonical slug value above.

The existing `player_insights_*` bundle resource keys remain unchanged. They are
non-user-facing state addresses, contain no retired brand, and are already bound
to the live schema, volume, App, experiment, jobs, and AI Search resources.
Renaming them has no display benefit and would require an unbind/rebind window in
which an interrupted migration leaves the bundle without ownership state.

The `example` target also keeps `player_insights_assets`,
`player_insights_telemetry`, and the Lakebase schema `player_insights` as
target-only compatibility values. Those names identify existing data-bearing
objects. New deployments receive the canonical
`player_insights_agent_assets`, `player_insights_agent_telemetry`, and
`player_insights_agent` defaults.

### Branding rollout and rollback

No resource key or live model/endpoint/experiment identity changes in this
rollout. Before releasing, change the ignored example
`app_source_code_path` override to the canonical
`/Workspace/Users/<release-actor>/player-insights-agent-src`; retired staging
suffixes are refused.

Then use the normal coordinated sequence:

```bash
TARGET=example PROFILE='<your profile>' bash bundle/deploy.sh
TARGET=example PROFILE='<your profile>' bundle/agent-release.sh --apply
TARGET=example PROFILE='<your profile>' bundle/app-release.sh --apply
```

At the bundle confirmation, stop if the plan proposes a delete, replace, or a
second App/model/experiment. The bundle step updates labels, comments, and tags;
the agent release records the canonical tags on a new model version at the same
registered model and endpoint; the app release moves query attribution and the
manifest short name to the same brand.

For model rollback, redeploy the prior registered version without logging a
duplicate:

```bash
TARGET=example PROFILE='<your profile>' \
  bundle/agent-release.sh --apply --skip-log --model-version <previous-version>
```

For app rollback, use `bundle/app-release.sh --apply --rollback-to
<known-good-workspace-snapshot>`. Reverting source and rerunning the interactive
bundle wrapper restores prior comments/tags if needed; it must still show no
resource deletion or replacement. Lakebase data and the retained target-only
schema/volume identities are unchanged in either direction.

## Before a later bundle reconciliation

The greenfield sequence includes one complete `bundle deploy`. For later
resource-only reconciliation, that command can remove a resource. Two of them
hold things that do not come back. `schemas.player_insights_schema` has the
registered model and app-owned semantic assets, and
`schemas.player_insights_telemetry_schema` has app history that does not backfill.
Both carry `prevent_destroy`, which stops `bundle destroy` and does **not** stop a
`replace`.

Use the same wrapper. It checks the known Lakebase state hazard before invoking
the CLI, then leaves the CLI's change list and confirmation visible:

```bash
TARGET=<target> PROFILE=<profile> bash bundle/deploy.sh
```

Do not add `--auto-approve`: the prompt is where the operator checks for a
delete or replacement. `bundle plan` is available for diagnosis but is not a
required step in this process.

## Verifying a deployment

A deployment can be built exactly right and still answer every question from
canned representative data, and none of these fail loudly. Establish that:

- both env-var-bearing app resources (`postgres` and `serving-endpoint`) are
  attached to the live app, and every `user_api_scopes` entry the bundle authors
  is in effect on it rather than merely declared. `databricks apps get
<app-name> -o json` reports the resources and scopes the platform actually
  holds, which is the one place a lost attachment shows;
- the serving endpoint exists and is reachable;
- the app's Postgres role holds grants on the schema the app's own DDL creates;
- every table each Genie space curates is inside the manifest the logged model
  declares. A table outside it fails every Genie call, and the agent's SQL
  fallback answers anyway.
