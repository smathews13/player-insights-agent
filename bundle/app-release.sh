  0. run bundle/release-gate.sh: the permissions the app declares against the
     ones it documents and the ones it holds, and every declared resource
     attached to the live app. THIS ONE STOPS THE RELEASE before anything is
     built. ~7s, two workspace reads.
     Run it now, without releasing:  TARGET=$TARGET bundle/release-gate.sh
  1. install exact package-lock dependencies with npm ci when node_modules is absent
  2. resolve the MLflow experiment id for '$TARGET' out of the bundle
  3. run the focused release-critical app/session/migration tests (not full Vitest)
  4. npm run build:deploy        (vite client build + esbuild server bundle)
  5. check the app owns its Postgres schema. THIS ONE STOPS THE RELEASE, before
     anything is uploaded: ownership cannot be repaired by a later deploy.
  6. resolve the app role, direct Lakebase branch host, Postgres database and
     operator role from the live bundle resources, then run
     scripts/grant-app-db-access.mjs. This STOPS the release on failure.
     Then grant the app's own service principal CAN_MANAGE on the app (a merge,
     never a replace) so the Identity members list can read the live App ACL
     instead of falling back to the stored roster. No-op once the grant is held.
  7. verify the active deployment runs from Databricks' separate SNAPSHOT path,
     then safety-check that $SRC_PATH is this app's staging directory directly
     below /Workspace/Users/<current actor>/
  8. recursively delete ONLY that validated mutable staging directory, then
     databricks workspace import-dir build/deploy $SRC_PATH --overwrite
     A delete or import failure stops here; the active snapshot keeps running.
  9. databricks apps deploy $APP_NAME --source-code-path $SRC_PATH --mode SNAPSHOT
 10. restore player-insights-agent/build/deploy/app.yaml, which the build wrote
     this deployment's administrators and experiment id into. Tracked file, and
     it publishes; nothing to remember afterwards.

# THE GATE, FIRST, BEFORE ANYTHING IS BUILT OR UPLOADED.
#
# Nothing above this line has touched the workspace or the deploy tree, so a
# refusal here costs the operator seven seconds and leaves the running app exactly
# as it was. What it asks and -- more importantly -- what it deliberately does NOT
# ask is written at the top of bundle/release-gate.sh, in one place, so nobody has
# to read two scripts to learn which checks gate a release.
#
# IT IS THE WHOLE POINT THAT THIS ONE BLOCKS. The advisory suites below report and
# continue, and the certification runner was moved behind --certify precisely
# because it printed without gating. This is the opposite: a permission the app
# does not hold, a resource it was told to use and has not got, or a read this
# project promises out loud that it cannot do. Every one of those has taken this
# deployment down or misreported it to a reader in the last day.
#
# NOT ON THE ROLLBACK PATH, which returns above this line. A rollback re-points
# the app at a source directory that was known good; refusing it over a
# data-access finding would keep a broken deployment broken to protect a
# governance claim that the rollback does not change.
#
# A CHILD PROCESS, SO IT COSTS NO EXTRA RESOLUTION. seed_bundle_cache above
# exported the resolved bundle, and PROFILE is passed explicitly because the cache
# is keyed on target AND profile: without it the gate resolves the bundle again and
# costs 16s instead of the measured 6s.
#
# ABSENCE IS TOLERATED, AND SAID OUT LOUD. The gate drives checkers that read the
# demo data-loading sources, which are excluded from the published tree, so it is
# excluded with them and a customer's checkout does not carry it. Dying
# here would make every customer release stop on a file we deliberately did not
# give them. This is the same treatment bundle/scope-contract.py gets below, for
# the same reason -- and it is NOT a skip mode: no flag reaches it, and in this

#   TARGET=<target> PROFILE=<profile> bundle/preflight.sh --live

# it is the one Postgres condition a release cannot repair and a redeploy cannot
# clear. Grants do not confer it, and the role running this cannot transfer it.
# The app's boot DDL is refused for as long as the objects exist, so shipping
# over it means shipping a deployment whose next schema change silently will not
# apply.

# Two failure modes, told apart on purpose: exit 1 is a finding and stops the
# release, exit 2 is a check that could not run and does not. A check that is
# unavailable is not evidence of a problem, and blocking a release on one
# teaches people to skip the step.

# release-gate.sh already compared declared, documented, and effective scopes

# safety. The status read above remains the one post-deploy platform read.

# LAST, and in SHADOW, on purpose.
#
# Last because it asks the RUNNING app about itself through its own public
# routes. Run any earlier and it would certify the deployment this release just
# replaced, which is worse than not certifying at all: it would produce a
# durable record, against a release tuple naming the new build, out of the old
# one's answers.
#
# Shadow because a gate that stops a demo is worse than no gate. The runner
# exits 0 in this mode whatever it finds, and the `if !` covers the other case:
# a crash here would report a broken release over a deployment that is already
# up and correct. The verdict is in the certificate either way, so promoting on
# it later is a matter of reading the record rather than of rerunning anything.
#
# The gating checks above are deliberately NOT removed in favour of this. They
# stop the release BEFORE the upload, and ownership in particular cannot be
# repaired afterwards.
