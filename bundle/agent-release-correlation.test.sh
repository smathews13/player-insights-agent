# Tests for the correlation gate in bundle/agent-release.sh.
#
# WHAT THESE ARE FOR: the gate refuses a release when a value somebody saved in
# the app disagrees with what the release would log. It has two ways to be wrong
# and only one of them is visible. Refusing a legitimate release is loud and gets
# fixed within the hour. PASSING something it was built to catch is silent. The
# old browser-route reader always returned 401 to automation because it had no
# app-session cookie. The replacement reads Lakebase directly with the release
# profile's OAuth credential and fails closed when that machine path cannot read.
#
# So each case below asserts an EXIT STATUS as well as the text. A gate that
# prints "REFUSED" and returns 0 satisfies any assertion made on output alone,
# which is exactly how the original defect survived review.
#
# HOW: the real script is run, unmodified, with `databricks`, `node` and `uv`
# replaced by stubs on PATH. Nothing here reimplements the gate. A test that
# restates the logic it is checking passes when the logic is wrong. Stubbing the
# CLI is also what lets a 401 be tested at all: the live app answers a human 200,
# and the branch that matters cannot be reached from this machine.
#
# Run:  bundle/agent-release-correlation.test.sh

    # A VARIABLE ADDED TO THE SCRIPT AND NOT ADDED HERE KILLS THE WHOLE SUITE,
