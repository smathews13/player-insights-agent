# Proof that bundle/model-user-auth-check.py refuses each way the model half of
# the user-authorization wiring can be missing, and passes only when it is whole.
#
# WHY THE SUITE EXISTS. A customer's first question came back as an HTTP 400
# carrying the SDK's `model_serving_user_credentials auth:` sentence, because the
# endpoint had no user credential to hand the container. The agent now answers
# that with a sentence a reader can act on; this gate is the other half, catching
# a version with no user auth policy at DEPLOY time instead. A gate whose failure
# has never been observed is a comment, and this repository has shipped four
# checks that could not fail.
#
# STANDARD LIBRARY ONLY for every assertion that counts. `bundle/run-checks.sh`
# discovers this file and CI runs it on a runner with no pip install, on the
# stated ground that a dependency is a way for a gate to stop running for reasons
# unrelated to what it checks. So the findings are proved through
# `--auth-policy-json`, which takes the same mapping MLflow hands back. The two
# MLflow doors are exercised at the end IF an agent environment is available, and
# skipped visibly when it is not, so a bare runner loses one thin call rather
# than the whole suite.
