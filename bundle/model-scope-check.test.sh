# Proof that bundle/model-scope-check.py fails on each of the model legs.
#
# The logged leg is driven by fabricated release summaries, so it needs no
# workspace. The configured and documented legs are proved by really editing
# databricks.yml, the semantic resource file and the generated contract, because
# the claim of those legs is that they track those files.
#
# WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS AT ALL. The contract distinguished the app's token from
# the model's from the day it was written, and nothing consumed the model half:
# `app-release.sh` ran the check against the app object and `agent-release.sh` ran
# no scope check of any kind. A leg with no consumer and no test is a comment.
