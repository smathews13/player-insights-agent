# What `databricks bundle deploy` would DESTROY, asked before it is run.
#
# NOT MARKED `# advisory-suite:`, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THE FILE. This gate
# blocks. The advisory suites report and are swallowed by bundle/app-release.sh,
# which is right for them: their findings are about workspace state OUTSIDE the
# artifact being released, so a release that ships over one still ships something
# correct. A plan that would delete a resource is the opposite -- it is a
# statement about what the next command does to the workspace -- so a green line
# and a continued run would be the worst of both.
#
# It is also NOT on the app release's path, and does not need to be:
# `bundle/app-release.sh` never runs `bundle deploy`. It uploads a source tree
# and calls `apps deploy`, so no plan of any shape changes what it is about to
# do, and a `delete` finding printed there would be a loud warning about a
# command nobody was running. Nothing in this repository runs `bundle deploy`;
# it is always a person at a terminal. So this is the step for that person:
#
#   TARGET=<target> bundle/plan-gate.sh && databricks bundle deploy -t <target>
#
# The `&&` is the whole design. Chained that way, an unreviewed destroy cannot
# reach the workspace, and the gate costs about 2 seconds against a deploy
# measured in minutes.
#
# ABOUT two seconds, not a decimal. The three places this file and bundle/README.md
# stated the cost said 1.6, 1.7 and 1.9 within a day of each other, all describing
# the same measurement -- which is the fault the rest of 2026-08-17 went to
# removing from app.yaml and databricks.yml, reappearing in the file that landed
# alongside the removal. A figure precise enough to disagree with itself and not
# load-bearing enough for anyone to re-measure should not be written to one
# decimal place in three files.
#
# WHY A GATE AND NOT A HABIT. `bundle deploy` prints its own plan and asks for
# confirmation, so in principle this is redundant. In practice a person who has
# typed `deploy` twenty times reads "Deploying resources..." and not the list
# above it, and the resources most worth not losing here are the ones that do
# not come back: `schemas.player_insights_schema` holds the curated tables, the
# registered model and the endpoint's inference tables, and
# `schemas.player_insights_telemetry_schema` holds app history that does not
# backfill. Both carry `prevent_destroy`, which stops `bundle destroy` -- it does
# NOT stop a `replace`, which is a delete and a create wearing one word.
#
# FAILS CLOSED ON AN ACTION IT HAS NEVER SEEN, which is the one design decision
# here worth defending. The CLI's vocabulary today is create/delete/replace/skip/
# update; this file allows the three that cannot lose anything and refuses
# everything else BY EXCLUSION, so a future CLI that introduces a sixth verb is
# refused by this gate rather than waved through it. A check that silently stops
# matching is this repository's most repeated bug -- a leak rule that matched
# nothing for months, four suites that asserted nothing, a `sed` script whose
# every rule was a no-op because BSD `sed` ignores `\b` and exits 0 anyway -- and
# every one of them exited 0. An allowlist of safe verbs cannot fail that way; a
# denylist of dangerous ones would.
#
# EXIT CODES follow bundle/app-release.sh's Postgres step, which tells the two
# apart on purpose:
#   0  the plan destroys nothing
#   1  a finding: the plan would delete or replace something
#   2  the check could not run, which is NOT evidence that the plan is safe
#
# Usage:
#   TARGET=<target> bundle/plan-gate.sh
#   TARGET=prod PROFILE=<prod-profile> bundle/plan-gate.sh
#   TARGET=<target> PIA_PLAN_ALLOW_DESTROY=resources.jobs.old_job bundle/plan-gate.sh

# DELIBERATELY NOT `resolve_profile`. That helper reads the profile out of the
# resolved bundle, which means `bundle validate`, which is around 8 seconds here
# against this gate's two -- it made the check several times its own cost to learn
# something the CLI already knows. `bundle plan -t <target>` reads `workspace.profile` from
# databricks.yml itself, so a target that names one needs nothing passed. PROFILE
# is forwarded only when the CALLER set it, which is what a target carrying no
# profile of its own (dev or prod) needs.
#
# Keep it that way. `validate` was being run 14 times per release at ~7.5s each
# before the resolution was cached once, and a gate that re-introduces one for a
# value it does not need is how that comes back.
