"""The `new_plot` tool: renderer-neutral chart specifications built from query results.

The model decides *what* to plot and supplies a small semantic chart contract. This
module validates that contract, adapts it to Plotly, and owns the DuBois palette and
layout defaults. The app renders the resulting spec with Plotly.js in the browser.

Legacy Plotly `data` and `layout` arguments remain accepted at the adapter boundary so
stored prompts and compatible endpoints keep working. They are an implementation detail,
not the semantic condition for a completed answer.

Nothing here knows what the data is about. Series names, axis titles, categories and
units all arrive from the model, which reads them off the result set, so the tool
survives the dataset being replaced underneath it.

`grid` and `updatemenus` are refused: one panel per chart keeps a chat answer
readable and keeps the client's rendering surface small enough to test.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Palette
#
# The Databricks DuBois palette, mirroring the token names the client defines in
# client/src/styles/tokens.css so a chart cannot drift away from the surface it sits on.
# The names in the comments are the CSS custom properties a reader can go and look up
# there: `--chart-1`..`--chart-4` and `--chart-emphasis` are the chart contract, and the
# `--db-*` primitives behind them say which meaning each hue carries elsewhere in the app.
#
# DuBois rations colour by meaning, and a chart obeys the same rationing as a badge does.
# Blue is action and identity, so it is the ordinary bar and the first series; orange is
# "the one being pointed at"; red is failure; amber is evaluation. That is why the retired
# brand red is gone from here rather than merely restyled: red as the default series made
# every ordinary breakdown read as an error.
#
# Two lists, because a colour that works as a filled mass does not necessarily work as a
# one-pixel stroke:
#
#   FILL_SERIES   bars, pie slices, histogram bins, box bodies.
#   STROKE_SERIES lines and markers. EVERY ENTRY CLEARS 3:1 AGAINST WHITE (WCAG's
#                 non-text minimum). All four palette hues clear it, so the two lists
#                 share their first four entries; amber (1.90:1) is not in either.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INK = "#161616"  # --db-ink: text on the figure, and the outline drawn around a pale fill
SLATE = "#6F6F6F"  # --db-slate: axis and tick labels
LINE = "#EBEBEB"  # --db-line: the hairline on a white surface — the hover label's border

# Gridlines, axis lines and the zero line, as a wash of SLATE rather than a fixed grey.
#
# THE BUG THIS FIXES. These three keys used to be `LINE`, which is #EBEBEB. On a white
# card that is a gridline. On the night sky it is a 12.6:1 near-white rule against a panel
# whose own bars only reach about 6:1, so the grid was the highest-contrast thing in the
# figure and read as the subject of it — the data was drawn *behind* the scaffolding.
#
# AN ALPHA RATHER THAN A HEX, and that is the whole trick. A chart spec is written by the
# agent and stored beside the answer, so the colour in it is fixed at write time while the
# surface it lands on is not: the same spec is drawn on a white card and on a dark one. A
# hex has to lose on one of them. A mid grey at low alpha composites against whatever is
# behind it, so it darkens white and lightens navy by the same amount and comes out a
# gridline on both. Measured, SLATE at 28%:
#
#   over #FFFFFF (light card)  -> #D7D7D7, 1.44:1 against the card
#   over #1F252A (dark card)   -> #353A3D, 1.35:1 against the card
#
# Visible enough to read a value against on either surface, and far enough below the marks
# that it cannot compete with them. The near-symmetry is the property worth having: it is
# what lets one baked value serve two themes.
#
# The client re-themes this key at draw time — client/src/plotly-config.ts maps `gridcolor`
# onto `--border` — so in the browser this value is replaced rather than used. It is still
# the right value to write, because it is what every surface WITHOUT that pass gets: a
# figure rendered without a document, and these tests, whose fallback theme is this file.

# Label geometry
#
# Two rules, and both of them are about the same thing: a label is only worth drawing if
# it has somewhere to sit. The category names and the slice shares arrive from the result
# set, so neither rule may assume anything about how long a name is or how small a share
# gets. What they can do is bound the space a label is allowed to ask for.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: Characters on one line of a wrapped tick label.
#:
#: Plotly reads `<br>` in a tick label as a line break, so a long category name can be a
#: short block of text instead of one long string. That is what lets Plotly keep the axis
#: horizontal at all: it measures the drawn text and rotates only as far as it has to, and
#: a name broken over lines is a quarter of the width it was.
TICK_LINE_CHARS = 14

#: Lines one tick label may occupy.
#:
#: The point of the cap is that the height the axis reserves is bounded by the layout
#: rather than by the longest name in the result set. Three lines of `TICK_LINE_CHARS`

ELLIPSIS = "\u2026"

#: The share of the total a pie slice needs before its label is drawn on the figure.
#:
#: Plotly puts every outside label at its slice's mid-angle and then pushes colliding
#: labels apart, drawing a leader line to cover the distance it moved them. A slice needs
#: roughly two label line-heights of arc for its label to sit where the slice is: on a pie
#: sized for this card that is about 4% of the total, so 5% is the round number above it.
#: Under that, several slivers share a mid-angle, every label starts in the same place, and
#: the result is the pile of crossing leader lines rather than a set of labels.
#:
#: Nothing is lost by not drawing one. Every slice is in the legend, and the tooltip
#: carries the label, the value and the share.

#
# THE BUG. A ranked breakdown of game titles came back as eleven vertical bars with the
# names along the bottom. Wrapping (above) bounds how tall one label can get but it cannot
# create width, and the panel is now half the answer column, so eleven names could not sit
# side by side however they were broken up. Plotly did the only thing left and rotated them
# to 90 degrees: a row of tall vertical strings, unreadable one character at a time, with
# the axis title stranded in the middle of them.
#
# Turning the chart on its side removes the constraint instead of negotiating with it. A
# horizontal bar gives every category its own ROW, so the name reads left to right at its
# full length and the axis grows sideways to hold it — and sideways is the cheap direction,
# because `automargin` can spend the panel's width on the left margin while height is fixed
# by the card.
#
# DECIDED FROM THE DATA, NOT ASKED FOR. The model has never seen the figure and cannot
# measure drawn text, which is the same reason it does not get to pick the tick angle or the
# legend's edge. What this module has is the result set: how many categories there are and
# how long their names run.

# out of the result set, so it holds after the underlying data is replaced.
PLOT_INSTRUCTIONS = f"""You turn one assessed data package into at most {MAX_CHARTS} \
chart(s) by calling new_plot.

Rules:
- Plot only values present in the package. Never invent, extrapolate, or round a number.
- Choose the shape from the result set: a ranked breakdown is a bar chart, a date or \
period series is a line chart, a distribution is a histogram or box.
- When the question asks for a particular chart type or names the axes, honour that \
request: use the named shape and put the named field on the named axis whenever the \
package supports it honestly. Fall back to the shape the data suggests only when the \
requested one would misrepresent it -- a pie asked for on more than {MAX_PIE_SLICES} \
categories, or a line asked for on rows with no natural order. A runtime chart contract \
stated below, when present, overrides the requested type.
{TWO_PANEL_RULE}
- A part-of-whole split is a pie only when it has at most {MAX_PIE_SLICES} categories and \
every category is at least {MIN_PIE_LABEL_SHARE:.0%} of the total. Otherwise plot the \
shares as a ranked bar chart. A pie with slivers in it hides the small categories and \
crowds the labels on the big ones; a bar chart of the same shares reads at any count.
- Several measures over the same categories are several series on one chart, each with \
its own `name`. Set `stacking` to "group" or "stack" when you mean it.
- Take every label from the data itself: series names from the column or category \
names, axis titles from the measure and its unit, the title from what was asked.
- A ranked bar chart is sorted for you, largest value first, so send the rows in \
whatever order the query returned them. A bar chart whose categories are dates or periods \
is left in the order you send, so send that one in date order.
- Leave a category out when it has nothing in it AND those categories are most of the \
chart: a null-ratio breakdown over twenty columns where eighteen are zero is two bars and \
eighteen empty rows to look past. Plot the ones with a value, and say in the answer how \
many you left out and that they were zero. Never leave out a category that has a value, \
however small, and never leave one out to sharpen a point.
- A breakdown where every value is zero is not a chart. Say so in the answer instead.
- One panel per call. Call new_plot once per chart, at most {MAX_CHARTS} times in \
total, and not at all if the package holds no plottable rows or only a single scalar. If \
the tool interface requires a response, send outcome "not_applicable" without a spec.
- Describe chart meaning only. The application chooses the renderer, colours, fonts, \
margins, figure size, legend position, and tick angles. Send labels exactly as they \
appear in the data; do not shorten or abbreviate a name to make it fit.

Reply with tool calls only; any prose is discarded."""
