"""Where the running agent's configuration comes from.

`Settings.from_env()` runs at IMPORT time inside the serving container, which
inherits nothing from the shell that logged the model. So configuration travels
INSIDE the model artifact: `log_model.py` resolves it from the bundle target's
variables and hands it to `mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(model_config=...)`, and
`mlflow.models.ModelConfig()` reads it back here on load.

THE ARTIFACT WINS over the process environment. Those same log-time values name
the resources automatic authentication passthrough grants, so a runtime override
could aim the agent at a warehouse the model has no permission to use. One
version of the model is one configuration.

NOTHING THAT NAMES A WORKSPACE'S DATA MAY HAVE A DEFAULT. Missing configuration
raises at import, failing the model load loudly, rather than answering plausibly
about the wrong company.
