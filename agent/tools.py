    Narrow rows get thousands; wide rows get `min_rows` and no more. Two further

# What the dictionary space is asked
#
# A dictionary space answers about a FIELD. Naming a table in the question
# invites its context step to pull that table in alongside the dictionary, and
# on a wide master table that is enough on its own to turn a 13.7 second answer
# into a call still in its LLM planning phase when the 45 second deadline
# arrives. The deadline is not the thing to move: it is sized against the 90
# second turn budget, so buying seconds there spends them somewhere else.
#
# So the table is dropped, and ONLY where it was scoping something else. A
# question whose SUBJECT is the table ("what is the grain of X", "what does X
# hold") has nothing left if X goes, and it is a question the dictionary space
# is supposed to be slow-ish about, because answering it does need the table.
# That is the whole of the distinction: a preposition in front of the name means
# the name is context, and context is what costs the time here.
#
# Dropping it is not free. Where the same column name lives in several tables,
# the table was load-bearing and the answer can now be confidently about the
# wrong column. That is mitigated rather than eliminated, in two places: Genie
# is asked to name the table each definition belongs to, and the caller is told
# in the result that the question was not scoped, so a mismatch is visible
# rather than silent. A caveat the model can act on beats a timeout it cannot.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: Words that put a table in a question as SCOPE rather than as subject.
#: Deliberately not "of" or "for": "the grain of X" and "the key for X" are
#: questions about X, and stripping the name leaves them asking about nothing.
_SCOPING_PREPOSITIONS = ("in", "inside", "within", "from", "on")

        THERE ARE TWO DEADLINES, not one, because there are two different waits
        happening and one number could only ever be right for one of them. A
        space that is ANSWERING gets `GENIE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, unchanged, and it
        is the right bound: past that the question is too big for this turn. A
        warehouse that is STARTING gets `GENIE_WAREHOUSE_START_SECONDS`, because
        nothing about the question is wrong and the wait is for infrastructure
        that takes as long as it takes. Time spent starting is then given back to
        the answer budget, so a warehouse that comes up at forty seconds still
        gets its full allowance to answer rather than arriving to find the
        deadline already behind it.

        Both are bounded by the turn, and the warehouse one is bounded by the
        turn LESS a reserve: it ends early enough that the finder still has
        budget for the tools that do not need this warehouse. Ending that way
        raises `WarehouseStarting` rather than `TimeoutError`, which is what
        stops a cold start being reported as a failed Genie call.

        THE GAP BETWEEN CHECKS GROWS, from 0.5s up to `GENIE_POLL_SECONDS`. It
        used to be that interval flat, so a question Genie finished in 0.3s was
        reported at 2s: the answer sat done while the turn slept out a cycle it
        had no reason to wait for. Most questions asked here are fast, so that
        was being paid on nearly every call.

        THE NEW CHECKS ARE ADDED BETWEEN THE OLD ONES, NEVER INSTEAD OF THEM,
        and the clamp below is what makes that true. Doubling on its own does not
        give you that: 0.5s then 1s then 2s puts checks at 0.5s, 1.5s, 3.5s, so
        an answer arriving at 1.6s would have been reported at 3.5s where the
        flat interval had it at 2s. Faster on average and sometimes slower is a
        bad trade for a latency change, and the case it loses on is the ordinary
        one. Clamped to the old grid the checks fall at 0.5s, 1.5s, 2s, 4s, 6s --
        a superset of the old 2s, 4s, 6s -- so this cannot report anything later
        than before, and reports a sub-second answer up to 1.5s sooner. The first
        check is still immediate, as it was.

        old path returned Genie's sentence with a note saying the sources were

        queried. But the states are not interchangeable, and calling all of them
        "failed" was its own bug: with the SDK's default `on_wait_timeout`, a
        statement still running at the wait timeout came back RUNNING and was
        reported to the model as `SQL RUNNING: statement failed`. It had not
        failed, and the model is instructed to report failures rather than work
        around them, so a slow query became a wrong answer about the data.

        Discovery stays on CANCEL at the 50s ceiling and never polls. Answering
        reads CONTINUE at that ceiling, with up to 300s of statement allowance;
        the remaining turn budget can stop it earlier so the model still has
        time to use the result.

        `retry_when_slow` runs the statement a SECOND time when the first was
        cancelled or never started, and only then: a rejected statement is
        rejected identically the second time, and a denial is about who is
        asking. It exists for the cold warehouse, where the first statement of a
        turn is the one that pays for the warmup and the second lands on a warm
        warehouse. Gated on the turn having enough left to use the answer, so a

        `columns` narrows the list to names containing any of the comma-separated
        patterns, matched case-insensitively as substrings. THE HEADER ALWAYS
        STATES BOTH COUNTS, because the valuable half of a filter is the miss:
        "0 of 412 columns match `crm_customer_ref`" is a definitive answer that
        the column is not there, and it is the answer that stops the model
        querying the table to find out and then guessing from the error.

        A DEFINITIVE NEGATIVE IS ONLY MADE WHEN THE READ WAS WHOLE. `total` is
        what the DESCRIBE returned against what came back inside the budget, so
        a truncated read cannot support "no such column exists" -- the column
        may be sitting in the part that was cut, which is exactly the case a
        wide table produces. Absence and truncation are reported as two
        different things, in different words, and the second one says what to do
        about it. Collapsing them would put the guess back one step further on.

        `DESCRIBE TABLE EXTENDED` on the declared warehouse rather than
        `tables.get`, so the description comes from the same compute that will run
        the query: a table the warehouse cannot see fails here, before the model
        writes SQL against it.

        Read on the ENUMERATION budget, because this is the tool that answers
        "which columns does this table have" and the list is the answer rather
        than evidence for one. On the sampling budget a wide table came back as
        the first fifty of its columns, and unlike the SQL path this one built
        its own text and so did not even carry the disclosure: the model was
        handed a partial inventory with nothing on it to say it was partial.
