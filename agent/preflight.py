"""What a release declares the agent may read, and what that grants it.

THIS MODULE GENERATES ACCESS. It is not a health check. The list
`resolve_declared_manifest` returns becomes the `DatabricksTable` resources on
the logged model version, and `agents.deploy()` grants the serving principal
SELECT on exactly those, so changing what this returns changes what the agent
can read.

Four things refuse a release:

  The CEILING past `MAX_DECLARED_TABLES`, because each entry is a dependency on
  the model version and Unity Catalog refuses a version with too many.

  The PAYLOAD-TABLE EXCLUSION. An AI Gateway inference payload table holds the
  prompts and completions of every request, so declaring one would grant the
  agent read access to its own users' conversations.

  An EMPTY MANIFEST, which produces an agent that can read nothing and fails at
  answer time looking like a broken workspace.

  The WIDENING REFUSAL. The manifest is generated, so it can broaden with no
  edit to any file; granting more than the previous version got needs
  ``--allow-widening``.

`python manifest_dryrun.py` prints what a release would declare, with every
exclusion and its reason, without logging anything.

#
# `schema`: enumerate every table Unity Catalog exposes in each
#   `catalog_allowlist` scope, then union the data contract in where it exists.
#
# `genie`: declare the tables the agent's two Genie spaces curate and nothing
#   else. It cannot declare a table that does not exist, because a space can only
#   curate one that does, and it cannot be large, because the platform caps a
#   space at MAX_GENIE_CURATED_TABLES.
#
# What `genie` mode costs: the contract tables are undeclared by design, so a
# question needing one is answered by saying it is out of scope.
# `governance_notes` states this at log time. The enforced SQL guard is
# unaffected in either mode, because it matches column names.
