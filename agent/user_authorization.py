"""Which identity the agent's data calls execute as.

Four principals are in play:

1. The signed-in human, who reaches the app as ``x-forwarded-email``.
2. The app's service principal, which is what the app authenticates as to
   Lakebase and to the serving endpoint.
3. The endpoint's automatic authentication passthrough principal, generated per
   model version and granted exactly the resources named at log time. This is
   what ``WorkspaceClient()`` resolves to inside the serving container.
4. The invoker of the endpoint, whose downscoped token Model Serving parks in a
   thread-local for the duration of one request.

Every question executes as (4). This module is the switch that says so, and it is
no longer a choice between two working modes: a version that resolves to (3) can
no longer answer a question at all. ``execution_identity.verify`` refuses every
request on such a version, and ``_runtime`` in ``agent.py`` will not build data
tools on the passthrough client. (3) survives only for the orchestrator's own
model calls, which read no customer data.

THIS IS NOT PER-USER GOVERNANCE AND MUST NOT BE DESCRIBED AS SUCH. "On behalf of
user" means the identity that CALLED the endpoint, which is the same principal
as the human only if the caller forwards their token. The app does not: it
builds its own client from the injected service-principal environment. So
turning this flag on alone moves execution from (3) to (2), a different service
principal. Forwarding ``x-forwarded-access-token`` on the invocation is the app
half, owned elsewhere, and is a prerequisite for the name to be accurate.
``executing_identity`` measures who a run actually used, because the SDK falls
back silently with no invoker token: no exception, no warning, a normal-looking
answer computed under the wrong principal.

THE FLAG IS BAKED INTO THE ARTIFACT because the two halves must agree or the
endpoint cannot authenticate at all. A ``user_auth_policy`` with no
``system_auth_policy`` leaves a bare ``WorkspaceClient()`` nothing to resolve,
and a user-credentials client against a version logged without a user policy
finds no invoker token. The container inherits no environment, so the runtime
half reads what log time decided and one resolution writes both.
