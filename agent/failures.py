"""The failure codes, as the agent side spells them.

NOT A SECOND TAXONOMY. `shared/failure-taxonomy.ts` is the authority and says so
in its own header: it owns the HTTP status, the sentence a user reads, the trace
behaviour, the alert severity, and whether a request ending on a code may still
carry an answer. Nothing here restates any of that, because a second table with
its own opinion about `httpStatus` is worse than no table: both look canonical,
and the one being read is whichever surface you happened to open.

What this module is for is the half the TypeScript cannot do. The agent runs in a
serving container with no access to that file, and it needs three things from the
contract at answer time:

- the code STRINGS, spelled identically, so a value that crosses the wire into
  Lakebase and the trace means the same thing on both sides. `test_failures.py`
  reads the `.ts` and pins them, because the two are released separately and in
  either order.
- which control fired, at the level of ONE piece of evidence rather than one
  request. A refused statement is not a failed request here: the loop discloses
  it and answers what remains, which is the existing and deliberate behaviour.
- whether a refusal may be worked around. This is the one property worth
  duplicating, and it is duplicated as a set rather than a table.

CANDIDATE-LEVEL CODES ARE NOT TERMINAL CODES. `TERMINAL_CODES` may only contain
what the shared file contains. `EVIDENCE_REFUSAL_CODES` are the finer-grained
reasons the evidence gateway rejects ONE candidate; they are recorded on the run
and counted, and they reach a user only through the terminal code they map to.
Anything here that ever needs to be a request's terminal outcome must be added to
the shared file first, which is where the meaning gets agreed.

THE CONVERSE IS NOT TRUE, and `APP_ONLY_CODES` is where that is written down: the
shared file holds codes this agent cannot reach, so "every shared code appears in
`TERMINAL_CODES`" is the wrong pin and would be satisfied by making this module's
own documentation false. See the block below the terminal list.

# Shared codes the agent cannot reach
#
# THE LINE, so the next person adding a code knows which side of it they are on:
# a code belongs here when the APP decides it on a request the agent is never
# invoked for, and belongs in `TERMINAL_CODES` when a run the orchestrator serves
# could end on it. These are settled in `admitRun` against the run
# ledger, before Model Serving is called at all, so no orchestrator code path
# could produce one; they are the shared taxonomy's only `request`-layer codes,
# which is that layer's own definition: the failure is the envelope the caller
# sent, not anything the run did.
#
# WHY THE SET EXISTS RATHER THAN JUST ADDING THEM ABOVE. `AGENT_CODES` is
# documented as every code the agent may put on one piece of evidence or one run,
# and that sentence is what a reader trusts when they consult it. Listing a code
# the agent cannot emit would make it false in order to satisfy an exact-match
# pin, which is paying for a green test with the meaning of the thing being
# pinned. Declaring the exemption instead keeps the pin honest in both
# directions: a shared code that belongs to the agent and was forgotten here
# still fails, because it is in neither set.
#
# MEMBERSHIP IS EXPLICIT rather than derived. Python cannot read the shared
# file's layers at import time, and an exemption that grows by itself is an
# exemption nobody reviews.
#
# Named here rather than beside the agent's own codes, so a reader looking for
# something to raise does not find one of these first.

# last one, SQL_CARTESIAN_JOIN, is a checked refusal rather than an un-checkable:
# it is candidate-level not because the guard was unsure, but because the shared
# file has no user-facing sentence for it, so it reaches a reader through the
# terminal code it maps to rather than as itself.
#
# None of them are in the shared file because no user-facing surface renders them:
# a run that produced nothing else ends on NO_VALID_EVIDENCE, which is.

#: same shape: nothing about a different route changes who is asking.
#:
