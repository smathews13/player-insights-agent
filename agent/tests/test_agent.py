"""What a turn does, and what bounds it.

What is pinned: that the loop cannot spin, that a bound produces a degraded
answer rather than a dropped turn, that an unanswerable question comes back as a
question, and that every cited source is a table the run actually read.

The fake model is scripted rather than clever. Each entry in `ScriptedLlm` is one
assistant turn, so a test states the exact sequence of tool calls it is about.
