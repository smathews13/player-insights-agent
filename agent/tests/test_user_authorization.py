"""The switch that decides which identity a question executes as.

Covered here: how the flag parses, which scopes it derives, how the client is
constructed, and whether the default is untouched. NOT COVERED, because it needs
a logged model version on a real endpoint: whether a downscoped invoker token
arrives in the serving container, and whether the scope strings are the ones the
platform recognises.

The bias is towards the ways this can be wrong quietly. A flag that does nothing,
a client cached across two callers, an answer that does not say whose grants it
was computed under: none of these raise.
