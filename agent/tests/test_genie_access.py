"""A Genie space that was never shared, and the answer that pretended otherwise.

Sharing a space with the serving principal at CAN RUN is a manual, UI-only step,
so it is the step a first deploy skips, and the space then refuses every call.

A space that DID NOT RESPOND may work next time and the sensible response is to
retry. A space that REFUSED will refuse forever and the sensible response is for
a person to open the Genie UI. Reporting the second as the first means every
remedy a deployer tries is one that cannot work.

These hold the distinction in the three places it has to survive: the classifier,
the instruction handed back to the model, and the answer the stakeholder reads.
