"""How the declared-table manifest is generated, and what it refuses.

Automatic authentication passthrough grants exactly the `DatabricksTable`
resources named at log time and nothing else, and the manifest is generated from
`catalog_allowlist`. That makes the allowlist load-bearing, and makes a mis-scoped
entry expensive: there is no `DatabricksCatalog` resource type, so a bare catalog
means one resource per table for every table in it. Hence the refusals below.
