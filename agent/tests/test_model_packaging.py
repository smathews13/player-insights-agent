"""Everything the served agent imports has to travel with it.

A module missing from `code_paths` is not a degraded agent. The artifact logs
cleanly, the registry accepts it, the endpoint is created, and then the container
fails to LOAD, which reads in the serving logs as an import error rather than as
"somebody added a file". It costs a deploy cycle to find, and the guard's absence
looks exactly like any other missing name.

So the list is derived rather than remembered: walk what agent.py actually
imports, transitively, and compare. Adding a module to the agent then either
updates this list or fails here, in a second, on a laptop.

The same derivation runs over the THIRD-PARTY imports and `pip_requirements`,
and that half is the worse failure of the two. `httpx` was imported by config.py
and declared by nobody: it arrived in the container as a dependency of openai,
which is not a promise, and when openai 3 moved to httpx2 it stopped arriving.
Nothing about that version LOADS differently. The endpoint reports READY, every
deployment check passes, and the first person to notice is whoever asks the
first question.
