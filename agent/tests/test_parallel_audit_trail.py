"""That a whole REAL turn's parallel tool calls still land in one audit trail.

`test_trace_context.py` pins `_in_trace_context` in isolation: given a span on
the dispatching thread, a worker's span nests under it. That is the helper, not
the loop, and the gap between them is where this defect would hide. The helper
copies whatever context it finds, so if the loop dispatched a batch from a point
where no span was active, every tool span would still open a root span in a trace
of its own -- and the helper's own test would keep passing while the run anybody
audits lost its tool calls.

So this drives a turn end to end, through `predict`, against a real tracing
backend, and asserts on where the spans actually landed: one trace, one parent,
no orphans, and the same shape whether the batch ran concurrently or serially.
The trace is what the Run Explorer, the per-request record and every "what did
this turn actually read" question are served from, so a dropped tool span costs
nothing at answer time and everything at audit time.

The serial case is asserted beside the parallel one deliberately. "The trace of a
parallel step is the same shape as the trace of a serial one" is the claim the
change makes, and comparing the two is the only way to test a claim about
sameness.
