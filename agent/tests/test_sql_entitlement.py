"""A serving principal with no `databricks-sql-access`, and the answer that
called it an outage.

Observed on a customer POC. Every direct-SQL tool was refused by the Statement
Execution API for a missing WORKSPACE ENTITLEMENT, and the stakeholder read that
"table descriptions did not respond during this run". Nothing did not respond: an
entitlement is an assignment on the identity, so it refuses every statement on
every warehouse until an admin patches the account.

The cost of getting this wrong is specific rather than cosmetic. The two remedies
a reader reaches for on a SQL refusal are `CAN_USE` on the warehouse and `SELECT`
on the table. Both are grants, an entitlement is not, so both of them run, change
nothing observable, and send the reader back.

These hold the distinction in the three places it has to survive: the classifier,
the instruction handed back to the model, and the answer the stakeholder reads.
