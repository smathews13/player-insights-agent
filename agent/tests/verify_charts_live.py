"""Runs the real agent against the live Genie space and LLM, and reports the charts.

Not a unit test: it needs credentials and a working warehouse. The pytest suite proves
`new_plot` is correct about specs it is handed; this proves the model reaches for it, and
that what comes back is shaped by what the query returned.

The four questions are phrased in terms of result *shape*, and none names a column, title
or series, so they still ask for the same four shapes after the dataset is replaced.

    uv run python tests/verify_charts_live.py [--out charts.json]

Writes the charts to JSON so the app can be pointed at real specs without redeploying.
