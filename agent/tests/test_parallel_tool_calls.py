"""That a step's concurrent tool calls behave exactly as the serial ones did.

The loop used to run a step's tool calls one after another, and every decision it
makes about a result -- is this a refusal, an access denial or an outage; does it
contribute evidence; does it brake the tool -- was made between two calls with
nothing else in flight. Now up to `MAX_PARALLEL_TOOL_CALLS` run at once, and the
whole safety argument is that the DECISIONS stayed sequential while only the I/O
moved: a worker does `_call_tool` and nothing else, and the results are read back
on the dispatching thread in the model's own order.

Nothing pinned that. The change landed with no test that a batch runs
concurrently at all, and none of the four properties below -- each of which is a
behaviour somebody using the app would notice losing -- was covered:

1. Distinct tools in one step really do overlap. Without this the optimisation
   could regress to serial and only a stopwatch would notice.
2. Calls to the SAME tool overlap too. The repeat brake cannot stop siblings
   already in flight, so calls that the serial path would have refused return
   their budget units after the repeated failure is classified.
3. One call raising does not lose the others. When the calls were serial the
   first failure stopped the batch; now three are in flight and the two that
   succeeded still have to reach the model, or a warehouse blip silently deletes
   evidence the answer was entitled to.
4. A governance refusal is still reported as a refusal, with its own message.
   `SqlRefused` is raised on a worker and re-raised here, and if it were caught
   by the generic handler on the way back the reader would be told a control that
   fired correctly was a surface that broke -- and the model would be invited to
   "try a different surface", which is how a refused query gets asked again
   somewhere the guard is not.

Overlap is measured by recording when each call entered and left and looking for
two spans that intersect, rather than by asserting on wall-clock totals: a timing
assertion on a loaded machine is a test that fails for its own reasons.
