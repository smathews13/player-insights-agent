"""App telemetry: off unless a target says otherwise, and never in the agent's schema.

Two properties, both of which are cheap to break by hand and expensive to notice.

The first is that telemetry is OPT-IN. Ingestion is billed, and this bundle is
deployed into customer workspaces, so a destination that reaches the top level
as a default opts every deployment of this repo into a charge nobody agreed to.
That already happened once in this repo with the semantic layer's AI Search
endpoint, which billed by the hour for five days while nothing queried it.

The second is that the telemetry tables live OUTSIDE the agent's own schema.
`manifest_source` in its default `schema` mode enumerates every table in each
`catalog_allowlist` scope and declares one DatabricksTable resource per table,
which is what grants the serving principal SELECT. `otel_logs` records who
signed in and when. Put the two in one schema and enabling monitoring quietly
widens what the agent can be asked about, on the next re-log, with nothing in
the diff to say so.

READS THE PUBLISHED SHAPE, NOT JUST OURS. mirror/prune-bundle-target.py removes
the internal target from databricks.yml on the way out, so a published tree
declares no telemetry at all. The target-level assertions below iterate over
whatever targets are present rather than naming one, so this file passes on the
publication and still holds the internal tree to both properties.
