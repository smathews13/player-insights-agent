"""That the same definition is looked up once a run, not once a question.

WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. The dictionary space is the slowest thing a run touches and
the model asks it one field at a time. In recorded runs that shows up as batches:
one step made eight back-to-back `dictionary_genie` calls totalling 84 seconds,
and another asked in step 3 for a column it had already looked up in step 2.
Genie is 48% of a run's wall time, so eight round trips where one would do is not
a rounding error -- and it is WORK, not waiting, so overlapping it would still
cost Genie eight questions and still bill for eight.

The fix removes the calls instead: several definition questions in one step become
one question, and a question this run has already answered is answered from the
run's own memo. Both are asserted here on the MECHANISM -- how many times the tool
surface was reached, how many replies the model got, how many copies of an answer
reach the evidence package -- because a wall-clock assertion over the handful of
runs that share the current span schema would prove nothing either way.

Four properties matter beyond the saving, and each has cost something before:

1. Every call still gets its own reply. A `tool_call_id` with no reply is a
   transcript some providers reject outright.
2. Nothing is invented. What a shared call reports is what the space said, with
   one line saying it was asked alongside the others.
3. One event is recorded once. A failed shared call is ONE outage, not eight, or
   the answer's caveats describe a surface that collapsed.
4. The repeat brake keeps its precondition. It is keyed on the tool name and has
   to see the first failure before a second call to that tool is issued; there
   is no longer a second call to see, which is stronger than serialising them.
