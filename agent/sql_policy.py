"""The SQL guard: one parse, one column policy, one manifest check.

MOVED HERE WHOLE from tools.py rather than reimplemented. This module is what
the evidence gateway is built on, and a gateway that held Genie to a SECOND
policy written to resemble this one is the defect it exists to prevent: two
checks meant to agree drift, and the one that drifts is the one nobody reads.
tools.py re-exports every name below, so the move changed no caller and no
behaviour, which is what the existing suite proves.

The only addition is a `code` on each refusal, from `failures`. It is set at the
raise site because the alternative is reading the message back to find out which
control fired, and matching English to classify a governance decision is how a
case-sensitivity bug once made a rule match nothing while exiting 0.

# was accepted a comma join, a `--` inside a string literal, a `/* */` pair
# spanning a UNION, and a restricted-column projection, because the table pattern
# only matched after FROM and JOIN and comments were stripped without any notion
# of a string literal, so the text being CHECKED was not the text that RAN. It
# also returned the wrong `sources`, so the Sources block named one table while
# the query read another.
#
# `sqlglot` builds an AST for the exact string that will be executed: one parse,
# no rewriting, no second version of the text. It is declared in log_model.py's
# pip_requirements. `sqlparse`, which arrives with mlflow, is a non-validating
# tokenizer and would leave comma joins, CTEs and set operations hand-rolled.

# root that is not a SELECT, a named table that is not three parts, a table
# expression that resolves to no name. A statement that names no table at all
# (constants, arithmetic) is allowed: there is nothing to index. There is no
# fall-back path, because falling back to weaker checking is how the previous
# version passed all of the above.

    THE QUESTION IS WHAT LEAVES, NOT WHERE THE COLUMN IS WRITTEN. Checking every
    SELECT in the tree answered a different question, and refused the analysis the
    product is for: week-over-week retention is a self-join over the set of
    players active in each week, so `platformid_accountid` must be projected by a
    CTE for the counts above it to intersect. Nothing individual reaches the
    result — the outer SELECT returns `count(DISTINCT ...)` and a ratio — and the
    refusal even advised counting, which is what the query was already doing one
    level up. There was no way to write the question that the guard would accept.

    So the values are FOLLOWED instead. `_query_carries` answers, for one query,
    which of its output columns would hand back a restricted value; a column
    read from a CTE or a derived table inherits that, an alias carries it, `*`
    republishes it, and a counting aggregate ends it. A restricted column is
    exposed only if it still carries at the top.

    That keeps every leak refused. `SELECT x FROM (SELECT email AS x FROM p) s`
    is refused because `x` carries `email` out; `SELECT c FROM (SELECT max(email)
    AS c FROM p) x` because `max` is not a reduction; `SELECT * FROM (SELECT
    platformid_accountid FROM p) s` because the star republishes it. What is no
    longer refused is the case where the value provably stops inside the
    statement: a CTE that isolates ids per week, a join key, an `IN` predicate.

    Projections are not the only way out, which is why two scans below are
    unconditional. A `LATERAL VIEW explode(array(email))` names `email` in the
    FROM clause and projects the alias, so the restricted column is in no
    `select.expressions` anywhere and the alias is what the warehouse reports as
    the result column, invisible to both halves of the defence, and it emits a
    different real value on every row. `UNPIVOT (val FOR col IN (email,
    display_name))` is the same shape in ANSI clothing: the identifiers hang off
    the table's `pivots`, and the result column is called `val`. Neither is
    followed through the value graph — they are refused wherever they appear,
    because the mapping from one to a result column is exactly what is opaque
    about them. A `LATERAL` wrapping a subquery is skipped, because that
    subquery is a source like any other and is followed as one.

    """Check SQL the agent did not write, and say what it reads.

    For Genie. The agent's own SQL is checked BEFORE it runs and anything
    unresolvable is refused; Genie's SQL arrives having ALREADY RUN, which
    changes what each answer is worth and so changes where the line goes.

    The column policy is applied in full and identically: `refuse_restricted_columns`
    is the same object `validate_sql` calls, so a statement refused one way is
    refused the other. Two things are deliberately NOT applied:

    The declared table set. `readable_tables` is the manifest baked in at log
    time, what passthrough granted the serving PRINCIPAL. A Genie space's tables
    are configured in Genie and are a different set that nothing here can see, so
    holding Genie to the manifest would refuse ordinary questions over any table
    the space can read and the manifest does not happen to list. That is a live
    refusal of a legitimate question in exchange for no confidentiality the
    warehouse is not already enforcing against Genie's own credentials.

    A parse failure. Returning no tables leaves the caller to decide, and the
    evidence gateway is where that decision now lives: an unattributable result
    contributes nothing rather than arriving with a caveat attached. This
    function stays deliberately silent about it, because it is also used for
    plain attribution.

    RESIDUAL RISK, stated plainly rather than implied by the absence of a check:
    an unparseable statement is uninspected here, and so is a `viz` attachment
    that carries no SQL at all. `SELECT *` is the sharper one: a static parse
    cannot expand a star without the table's schema.

    That last one is closed elsewhere, twice over. `_genie_rows` fetches the
    result set and runs `restricted_output_columns` over the schema the fetch
    returns, which is the same authoritative check the SQL path makes, and the
    gateway will not admit an attachment whose schema it never saw.

    THE ONLY COST CONTROL IN THIS MODULE, and it is here rather than left to the
    warehouse because of how the warehouse says no. The finder, asked for the
    pairwise and three-way overlaps between several titles, could not work out
    how to reference its other CTEs from inside one aggregate, so it reached the
    aliases by joining each CTE to ITSELF and wrote the predicate against the one
    alias it had:

        FULL OUTER JOIN players p2 ON p2.platformid_accountid = p2.platformid_accountid

    -- each commented `-- placeholder`. A predicate that names one side is a
    constant, so there is no key to hash on and Spark plans a broadcast nested
    loop join over sets of ids in the hundreds of millions. What comes back is a
    broadcast-size / driver-memory error, after the statement has spent the
    turn's whole wait budget being planned, and reading as a memory limit rather
    than as the cartesian product it is.

    STATICALLY DETECTABLE, which is why this one is worth guarding and the general
    "is this query too expensive" question is not. A predicate that mentions a
    single alias cannot relate two sources, whatever the data looks like, so
    nothing here is an estimate.

    REFUSES ONLY WHAT IT CAN PROVE. An unqualified column in the ON clause
    (`ON x.k = k`) is left alone: the warehouse resolves the bare name against the
    other side and the join is fine, and the parse cannot tell that from here
    without a schema. So the rule is every column in the clause naming the SAME
    ONE alias, or the clause naming no column at all (`ON TRUE`, `ON 1 = 1`), both
    of which are the same plan.

    NOT APPLIED TO JOINS WITHOUT AN `ON`. `USING (id)` names its key and is a real
    equi-join. An explicit `CROSS JOIN` is deliberately out of scope: it is the
    same hazard, but it is also how a scalar is legitimately attached to a result
    set, and refusing it would cost queries that work to catch a mistake nobody
    has made here.

    Applied across the whole tree, CTEs included, because that is where the
