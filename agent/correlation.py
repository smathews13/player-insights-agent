"""The one id that names a question in the trace, as it is named everywhere else.

The app mints it before the request leaves the browser and sends it as
`custom_inputs.request_id`; `player-insights-agent/shared/correlation.ts` is the
other half of this contract and holds the reasoning for why the browser mints it
and why it is not the run ledger's primary key. This module's job is narrower:
put that id where MLflow can be SEARCHED by it, so a question the app logged can
be turned into the trace of the run that answered it.

WHY TAGS AND NOT ONLY SPAN ATTRIBUTES. An attribute is readable once you have
already found the span, which is the problem, not the solution: `search_traces`
filters on tags. A correlation id that only exists as an attribute joins nothing
-- an operator holding an id from a log line still has to open traces one at a
time until one matches. So the ids are set as trace tags, and repeated as
attributes on the orchestrator span for a reader who opens it directly.

WHAT THIS SIDE KNOWS AND THE APP SIDE DOES NOT. The release facts here are the
ones baked into the model artifact or resolved by the served entity: the build
the agent was logged from, and the warehouse and spaces its data calls bill
against. The app records the other half beside them in the run ledger -- release
id, bundle target, app name, workspace and serving endpoint (`releaseIdentity` in
server/lib/run-admission.ts). Neither side guesses the other's: an agent reading
`DATABRICKS_APP_NAME` out of a serving container would record whichever app was
deployed last, or nothing, and both read as fact.

NOTHING CALLER-SUPPLIED IS PRINTED OR STORED UNVALIDATED. `custom_inputs` is an
untrusted body. A trace tag is queryable text stored beside a run and a print is
a log line, so an unchecked value there can forge a line, or carry a question's
text into the one place that deliberately does not record questions. `usable`
holds both ids to the shape the app mints and drops anything else, which is why
`request_id` reaches a tag through this module rather than directly.
